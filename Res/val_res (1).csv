A while a go in my senior year at high school (12th grade), I was stabbed in the back by one of my long-time friends: He told everyone in our circle - including a girl I had a crush on - that I had said something to him along the lines of ""I want to rape your 14 year old sister"", and without question, they all believed him. It didn't help matters either that he had his rat-fucking-bastard-cunt-stain-on-the human-race friend reinforcing that lie to everyone.
They also used to call me a ""Terrorist"" and a ""Sand Nigger"" because I'm from Iran. I constantly told them that I didn't like this, but they continued to do it. Then, all of a sudden I'm the bad guy because I ""said"" something about his sister, which I never did.
I won't go into detail about why I think he did this, but I think one of the reasons is he's sensitive about is his height. He tried to play it off as if he doesn't care, but he obviously does. I used to be the short kid of the group, but around 16 I had a growth spurt and now I'm 1.8m, while he's stuck at 1.68m or some shit like that, and every time the topic of height came up, he'd always say some bullshit like ""the measurement tape is off, you're actually 1.74m"" or something like that, to which I always replied ""Ok, buddy. Whatever you say.""
Before that time I was occasionally smoking pot with a few of my other friends, but I started smoking more and more after this incident and started skipping classes to go cry in my car like a little pussy (mostly because this cunt had ruined my chances with who I thought at the time to be the most beautiful girl ever), and this pretty heavily impacted my grades. Luckily, though, this happened in the final term of school, so my failing grades didn't prevent me from getting into university.
During holidays between high school and uni, I started dabbling in harder, more sedative drugs like Valium and Tramadol, because weed just wasn't cutting it for me anymore, and then I found Heroin.
I'd heard about how dangerous Heroin can be. How it can destroy lives and ruin you financially etc., but at that point my depression and loneliness was at it's peak, so I didn't even care.
I shot up for the first time, and I felt fucking amazing. I was just in a euphoric dream for hours and I loved every microsecond of it. It just helped me escape from my horrible reality and experience joy for the first time in a long time.
As of now, I'm in university with zero friends, severely depressed, lonely and scared. I've always been very socially awkward and anxious, but now I have a newly formed distrust of people, which is preventing me from making any new friends. Heroin seems to be the only friend I have right now, and the only friend that I can trust to give me a good time. I don't use it too much, though. Probably only once or twice a week when I either come home from work or uni. 
My parents don't know about this though. I mean, they know about the incident at school but not about the Heroin. I love my parents. I love them so much, so I don't want them to know. It'll ruin them; they'll be more damaged from finding out I do Heroin than someone who is using Heroin.
I sometimes go onto Instagram or Snapchat and I see that those cunts that did this to me are hanging out and seeming to have to best times of they're lives, and I hate that. I HATE them.
I just hate that good for nothing waste of human life that did this to me. I wish him nothing but misery and pain for the rest of his miserable, wrenched life. I fucking hate his guts. I want that little fucking short midget piece of shit cunt to go rot away in a huge pile of cow shit where he belongs. I fucking want him to die a slow and horrible death, isolated from everyone, and hated by everyone. I hate him. I FUCKING HATE HIM.
I'm not posting this here for you to tell me to ""go get help"" or ""go to rehab"" or anything like that, because I already know I can do that. In fact, I actually don't know why I'm writing this post at all. Maybe I'm just venting, maybe not, idk. If you read this whole thing, thank you. Just comment something to try and make me feel better please. I feel so terrible."

No one really cares.

Eventually I tried to end it. It didn't work, so I tried harder 2 weeks later. I landed in the ICU for 3 days and a psych ward for a week. I was pissed. They made me start on meds and go to therapy 8 hours every day. When I got out, I spent the next 3 weeks with my family, so I couldn't try anything because everyone was watching me like a hawk. But over that month of being on meds, I gradually wanted to die less and less. I was still pretty unhappy, but not suicidal. 
I got up the courage, thanks to my husband, to go to a doctor and ask if there was anything else I could do to feel happy instead of just not suicidal. She prescribed two other meds, so now I take 3. They worked.
Now, I'm not just not suicidal, I'm consistently happy. It's something I haven't felt in 8 years. Every time I feel that joy a tear or 3 roll down my cheek because I spent the last 8 years miserable, when $20/mo of prescriptions would have changed that. I'm crying now typing this out. 
Now, when I face challenges, I want to figure out a way to overcome them instead of figuring out the most painless/clean way to die. I can genuinely smile again?? I want to keep the commitments I made to my friends? It's honestly kind of bewildering. 
I'm a little scared of happiness after these years, but it feels so good. The people around me seem more friendly because I'M more friendly.

Trust me I know. I want to try and sum up in a few paragraphs what depression means to me and how I’ve learned to deal with it and understand it. 
If the cause of our depression is out of our control, we have to try and acknowledge the fact that life will throw us curve balls, takes the wind out our sails and pull the rug from under our feet when we least expect it. It’s not about what happens to us it’s about how we deal with it that matters.
My depression has been caused not by uncontrollable life events, but by my own stupidity, my own poor decisions, my own silly behaviour, my own horrific mistakes. My sadness was caused by nothing but myself. This is a much more bitter pill to swallow but can still be fixed over time. 
However our depression came about, it is our brain that is overwhelmed by negative thoughts. Be it anger or self hate, suicide or self harm, past distresses or consequences. Negative thoughts are playing on a loop in our brain, the longer we allow the negative thoughts to continue the harder it will be to emerge from our depression. 
I know, trying to tell a person with depression to think positively sounds like a load of bullshit right? But introducing positivity is the only thing that will work. We have to try and see a positive way forward, where we exercise and eat nutritious food. Where we hang out and laugh with friends. Where we start to love and care for the people around us or picture ourselves with a new partner and finally move on from that emotional break up. 
For me, when I’m at my lowest I would lose my appetite and wouldn’t go to the gym. I would lose muscle mass and start to look skinny. When I did eat it was just junk food to make the hunger go away. My sleeping pattern was lost and I had dark circles under my eyes. I stopped cleaning my house and allowed it to get messy and unhygienic. I stopped seeing friends and family and cancelled plans because I looked horrific. My job suffered and my finances took a hit. 
No matter how bad things appear we should try to remain positive in the important areas of our life. Depression will come and go but our health and hygiene can deteriorate quick when we don’t look after ourselves. Building up from rock bottom each time is difficult, try to avoid hitting rock bottom by staying positive enough to look after ourselves well. 
Laying in a dark room and obsessing over events that happened last week, last month or last year will get us nowhere, a nutritious meal and phone call to a friend will get us somewhere. Allow positivity in and slowly our depression will ease.

A few years back, I was lucky enough to be accepted by a boarding school where every parent wished their child could study. There, I got all A's in my country's equivalent of SAT exams and got a scholarship as a result. During this scholarship, I did another exam and passed it well enough to be able to extend my scholarship and soon study overseas.
You would think after all of this I would be happy and proud. I thought so too.
After getting the results, I felt empty. I got what everyone my age was aiming for and a life-changing opportunity but why do I feel like I still lost? Where is that gratification and sense of victory that everyone was hyping up about? Why am feeling sad and not happy instead?

But here is the thing, to manage the golf course he had to move out of Richmond, Virginia, to Akron, Ohio. He bought a new house before selling his old house, only to find that his attic has tons of water damage. The repairs itself will cost about $175,000 when he only spent $235,000 on the house in the first place (this was in the 90s). The worst part about it is the house he bought in Akron (which is a REALLY expensive city to live in) cost about half a million. He took out loans expecting to pay it off because of how profitable miniature golf courses are, especially in a really upscale place like Akron, Ohio.
But the story gets worse. The Golf Course itself has tons of problems. Most of the clubs aren't PGA standard. The old owner was disobeying the law and dodging taxes to maintain a profit. When my uncle became a new owner, the PGA did a mandatory inspection, fining my uncle $25k and forced him to spend another $12k in repairs and equipment upgrades. On top of that, now that the golf course has such a bad reputation, he is losing business, and people are going bowling instead. For those of you that don't play golf, bowling and golf are rival sports. This is sinking my uncle into a serious depression costing him tons of money in therapy.
So anyway my family goes out to Akron to cheer him up, taking him to the Olive Garden. But my BITCH sister couldn't just be normal. She starts SCREAMING at my Uncle for supporting Joe Biden instead of Bernie Sanders. My sister then killed his pet goldfish he always takes to restaurants with him for good luck. My uncle has had this goldfish for 27 years. My sister made such a huge scene that my ENTIRE family (including my uncle) is banned from Olive Garden forever. Since my family (especially my uncle) is SUPER Italian, this was a huge blow to his ego.
So basically my uncle is in serious debt, his miniature golf course is failing, my sister murdered his goldfish, and on top of all of that he is also banned from Olive Garden (even on Sundays)."

I think some of it is because my life circumstances are horrible and some of it is just because I have depression and a bunch of other chronic illnesses. I can’t really do anything about either problem bc I’m completely overwhelmed and I have basically no support. 
Whenever I try to address my terrible life circumstances, it backfires and they get much much worse. I’m in grad school and it’s absolutely awful right now and I can’t leave and when I try to talk to advisors, deans, ombudsmen, etc their “help” is next to useless, sometimes talking to them makes the problem even worse than before. I’m completely dependent on grad school for income, health insurance, etc and I’m so physically and emotionally exhausted that I don’t even have the capacity to look for a different job. I’m honestly so incapacitated by depression that I don’t really think I can work at all but I’m not even sure that I can go on disability right now.
I have a lot of health problems that are poorly managed and basically no support for those either. I keep telling my doctors that I feel awful and have zero quality of life and they mostly just ignore me, tell me I’m a hypochondriac and there’s nothing wrong, treat me like a human scab and talk to me like a house pet. My therapist and psychiatrist keep telling me how “great” I’m doing and when I ask them where they get this idea that I’m doing great they won’t answer. I keep repeatedly, urgently telling them that I feel terrible and they basically just tell me that I’m fine and I don’t need anything. 
I don’t know what to do. Normally when you’re having a problem at work, you talk to the people at work about that problem and they help you. Normally when you have a medical problem, you talk to a doctor and they help you. I don’t even have the support of my family right now bc they keep talking about how “great” I’m doing and how I’m “so much better.” Whenever I say that I don’t feel better, I actually feel worse they just tell me that I’m stressed and that I’ll feel better once I take a vacation.
How the fuck am I supposed to make my life better if ALL of my support systems are offering me no support? Everyone says “ask for help when you need it” when someone is considering suicide, but here I am repeatedly asking for help and being told I don’t need it and nothing’s wrong.

I know how that silent scream
Though painfully soundless it may seem
How its voice shatters your mind open
Hoping everything will end
Hoping that one day no one would remember
That time you almost pull the trigger
I know how to breathe yet drowning
Standing on the edge without jumping
Yet how it feels like you're constantly falling
Falling apart bit by bit while thinking
Should I do it, am I brave enough?
Asking, am I truly enough?
That coldness of steel on skin slicing
Through the relief and the tears it bring
And the warmth of that pool of red
How you have finally bled
The thoughts of how many times you've died
Along with the crushing grief inside
Those times when you can't even feel
And tell which is fake and which is real
Maybe a noose can show you what's true
Maybe it'll show how irrelevant is the real you
A short drop then you'll be forever flying
A worthlessness on a rope ever hanging
Countless ideas still bore a hole in my head
Should I rest or continue it instead
Then I'll realize how weak I truly am
How pretentious and fragile I really am
Maybe I really don't have the strength
Maybe I really want it but I just can't
It's then that I have found a friend
It's the truth that maybe suicide just couldn't mend
Instead it's my palms that hug my swollen face
Bruises that again made my heart race
That hope of a dreamless night without a stop
That undying hope of sleeping without waking up"

So maybe this is more of an upset feeling or something? Regardless, it's been getting to me. A few days ago making this post it was new years eve. I came home from Maryland to Pennsylvania for the holidays, and Christmas was nice. There was a small family party and I drank a little and made small talk and caught up with other people, then we all went our separate ways. Non of that bothered me. Then on new years eve, again I talked to the 2 other family members that showed up to my parents house along with me. We watched some tv, and it was nice again. But about an hour after everyone left and the house went dark I kinda just sat down and just started thinking. 10 years ago I was in 8th grade, was hanging out with after school, on christmas break, and was generally having a great time. Now I'm grown up, and dont really do much. I work, eat, do college work, play a little xbox or watch some tv, then sleep. Then repeat. Then I started thinking more how everything I used to have is gone. A lot of my friend moved and are gone, a lot of the shows I watched are off the air, places I went are gone, and places i used to go i cant anymore. Then it became clear how fast time went. It feels like yesterday I was on summer break, playing twisted metal on my ps1, my mom making chicken ramen in a pot, riding my bike up and down the street for hours, playing catch in the abandoned lot across the street, walking to my friends house to play gamecube, and standing out front of my house with my dad drinking a soda while him and his friends drank their beers. I started looking ahead after that. For my degree I'll be leaving country to work, most likely itll be around a 25 hours flight home then. So ill be leaving my home town further behind, so far to the point I cant make a week trip every now and then. More like a 2 week trip every year or 2 if I'm lucky. Not only leaving my town, also my childhood friends, family, house, places as well. My parents are getting older and people in my family are starting to die so I know that's coming. Its just.... wierd. I dont know if anyone else gets these feelings but this is a first for me. I wanted to go overseas to hopefully make a life there and have people from here come to visit and experience what it's like somewhere else, but it really really sucks knowing I'll be leaving my town behind. Even though it's a small town and theres honestly nothing to do and everything is really dated, its home, you know? My family's been in the area since the early 1900's and now here I am, feeling like I'm walking out on everyone. If anyone actually read this and made it to the end and has any advice or wants to talk, lemme know. My parents never had this problem, all my friends moved but not super far away, so they can always visit regularly, and my girlfriend has lived in like 7 different towns so she doesnt really understand the 23 years of attachment I have. I hope everyone has a wonderful new year, and if you do still live with family or close by make lots of memories and hold onto them, because you never know when that's all you'll have left of everything you once had."

When I was depressed, I had three dreams about suicide, and each of them shook me up and I’ll never forget them. Lately, I’ve been having some signs of relapse creeping in which have been haunting me, and yesterday I had a nightmare about suicide which really messed me up.
In the dream, it was a sunny day and I was outside my fraternity house where some of the other brothers were hanging out, all laughing and smiling and having a great time. There was a group of my other friends there, none of whom were in my fraternity, and I went to go hang out with them; but one of them kept making jokes about ending her life when she was serious (in real life she’s not depressed or remotely mentally ill at all so I don’t know why I conjured this up). She was saying stuff like “well when I jump off a bridge this won’t matter” and everyone was laughing, but I burst into tears in the dream because she was one of my favorite friends and I couldn’t stand the thought of her suffering. To make matters worse, I was having thoughts of suicide myself in the dream. One of the other people in the group looked at me while I was crying and asked, “what’s wrong?” and I said “because none of these people around me will be here after I end my life.”
Then I started thinking about the pain of suicide in the dream, thinking about the anguish that people’s parents, siblings, friends, and lovers must feel when they think they could’ve done something to stop it and they start to blame themselves. I said to myself “I hate thinking about suicide” and cried even harder, and then I “woke up” in the dream (but not actually in real life). Then after I woke up from that dream into another dream, I was suddenly in my best friend’s house traumatized from that dream I had. I was going to see my girlfriend soon, but I was still depressed from that dream and started getting mad at myself for not being happy and thinking about ending my life even though I have her. Then I actually woke up into real life and was completely shaken by what my subconscious had generated.
I wanted to tell my friends about the dream I had but thought it was too morbid to tell them, so I thought maybe typing it out could help me get over it."

I was gonna wear a sparkly silver dress for New Year’s Eve but my boyfriend called attention to the mole on my back and asked me to change because it was “kind of gross” and making him uncomfortable. 

I never really get dressed up or try to look girly —mostly I try to spend time on my writing— and I’ve just been reminded why. 

“I’m gonna be at this club with a lot of hot girls and I want my girlfriend to look as good as possible, sorry but you don’t look good in that dress. Not with that big mole on your back. Some people just aren’t meant to wear dresses. It’s not me that made it this way, it’s just the way the world works” - my boyfriend 

Funny how no one ever told me that before in all my 23 years. But I guess it takes some people time to learn how the world works. 

I have changed into a t shirt and jeans.

I’m not sure why I posted this, maybe for pity, maybe for you to tell me I’m disgusting. Honestly either works. He suggested I sell all my dresses on eBay to pay for a mole removal but they apparently cost like $800 and they can grow back. So I don’t really even want to bother."

I did. Why? I’m a fool. I’m a fool who never learned to be a man. I saw Showgirls once (or eight) when I was fourteen recording it on vhs from my dad’s bootleg cable tv setup (yeah I’m 37, in self-loathing years I feel only a day shy of dead tired) and besides trying to watch it on mute with a boner that could cut diamonds I thought “hey wouldn’t it be cool to be the guy at the bar/club everyone knows and all the women think is a mysterious bad boy?”
This foolish way of thinking persisted as I focused on what I didn’t “have” in life. I thought it was empty, yet exciting, chapters of sexual conquest. Rebellion at the rigidity of following trends, living for wild nights and eating party drugs at dives and snorting coke off hookers and strippers. What I really was seeking was Validation: Someone in high school to acknowledge I was “accepted”, girls to look at me like, well to look at me at all. That Validation is bittersweet, you are never fully satisfied when you get it because you don’t feel worthy of being happy. 
You aren’t given self-worth you fight for it. 
Yeah, I started late but I did that. The rockstar shit with no musical talent. I lived in Atlanta most of my life until about two years ago in a single bedroom with no roommates for about three years. All I did was work enough odd jobs to pay rent and buy about a gram of blow every few weeks, some weed and two weeks worth of groceries. I lived for the weekend of going to my favorite bars and seeing the regulars and using “game” to see who I could pull that night.
Yeah that “game”. I was one of those lame guys looking up PUA techniques back when the pick up artist Mystery was a thing on VH1. In fact I got to deep in the dreaded toxic red-pill way of thinking for a while. That phase is long gone now. Men and women are fucking devious to each other until proven otherwise. I’ve embraced this.
Also while I’m at it, FUCK ROOSH V. Moving on.
A life of the bad boy lifestyle, for lack of a better term, turned on me three years ago. Ironically during sex with a beautiful but fragile Indonesian college chick I met at my best dive in the city. At one point in the middle of it we went from madly entwined, filthy, primal. Then I 🥜 and we are laying parallel in my bed naked on a balmy Sunday night. That moment right after cumming and all the dirty talk where your naked skin can’t hide your feelings she tried to have a real conversation with me:
“Why? This is a hookup. We agreed before she got here”
I switch on the charm and get her mind thinking about my dick rather than my personality, but I knew something had changed in me. Looking back now it was the beginning of me wanting more, someone in my corner. Not a lover, a trophy of how masculine I was, not a crazy sexy story, I wanted a partner in crime. A best friend that liked my genitals, someone who wanted to “understand me”.
I don’t have to go into details you already know. I hurt her, she really tried to get to know me and hang again but I blew her off. She was one of a few. I still carry that weight.
So being bored and restless in Atl I somehow convinced myself that Las Vegas Nevada was the place for a wild boy like me. In reality I should of stepped away from the partying and figured out why I had this restlessness and why the old shit was leaving me more hollow.
So I moved. To make a long story a little shorter, Karma has caught up to me. I’ve been here two years. Since I “rebelled” against proper advice and building any type of fallback skill or career I have no real career skill, just retail history and some warehouse years. I’ve only managed to gain part-time gigs and temp work.
My mom actually moved here to help and brought my pup too. My 8 year old German Shepard who I’m currently ignoring cause she doesn’t need to be around me in this shape. I’ve never physically abused her, but my antisocial mood sweeps are affecting her and my poor mother who is actually taken to Las Vegas much better than I. I’m dragging them both down with my moody bipolar bullshit and it’s getting worse and worse between us all.
Sex life is purposely in timeout. In two years I’ve met women as shady and distressed as me. Junkies chicks that offered me Meth just for letting them bum a cigarette, local Nevadan women so destroyed by dealing with gambling addicts and dudes who love the alcohol more than human decency, a few prostitutes (yeah I know, fucking kill me alright), broke strippers with gold hearts, and aborted attempts at having an affair with a woman that was engaged.
I feel like I definitely deserve this. I’m amazed I don’t have kids and a few stds. I’m a freak but a cautious one. 
Last year after Thanksgiving I went in my bathroom with a butcher knife. My dog barking at the front door at whoever. I’m in their with my phone, the knife at my wrist and about a half oz of weed (just in case I decide to not kill myself). The ONLY reason I didn’t do it was because I decided to call a suicide hotline for the first time ever. I cried like two newborn babies when the woman on the other end, with the gentleness of a maternal god said to me:
“The fact that you called, shows that you don’t want to end it all. You just want someone to understand you”
Such a simple observation it seems insulting. Like “yeah no shit”. She might as well told me the Secret to Eternal life, that’s how hard her words hit. I hung up the phone and smoked the weed.
Now here we are, 2020. I skipped some details, but I’m so goddamn weathered and beat up internally and externally. I can’t let go of “the weight” and guilt of my lust for life. I lived my life based on being the “bad boy” and look at me. No career, nicotine addiction, no family of my own, no partner in crime that likes my genitals to build a life with. I’m 37 and I’ve fucked up my whole life. $5 in my bank account, I’m avoiding calling friends now too. 10 lbs lighter and I’m just lying in bed like fuck it.
Why is this fuck up still here contributing nothing? Should of finished the job at 14 instead of watching that stupid movie thinking being a bar crawling scumbag would be a life worth living. Should of did it last year, I really really want to be out of everyone’s way including my own.

I haven't cut myself in about 10 or 11 years, but over the last 2 days I've created a pretty big mess of my leg. it just felt so good to be in control of something in me for a change. I've been having daily meltdowns, extreme mood swings for months, and now I am at the psychotic break. I really wish in-patient was a financially realistic option, because I know I am at that point, and need to commit myself for a bit. I just keep trying to survive another day. But my behavior to and around others isn't something I can let slide anymore. I have a ridiculously complicated backstory medically, physically, socially that make me the bundle of fun I am now. I am officially considered to fall under long-term disability because I can only function in a very controlled environment (my house) with out severe vestibular symptoms, and essentially my cognitive abilities to disappear. 
Over the past 2 months I decided to give in and experience a sexual relationship with another girl. She had been interested in me in years, and I only found out a year ago, when I had a panic attack and said I couldn't do it and was afraid it was her and my husband trying to have an excuse to hookup. So they dropped it, until it came up again in November,  and I said I wanted to try it. My husband supported it, hell he helped orchestrate it. We just had to wait a while for her fiance to get on board.
We finally did and I got to experience having sex with another woman... and it was unbelievably amazing.  I always thought I was just bi-curious, but I didn't know if I really felt that way about women or if it was just a kink. Definitely more than just a kink. I want to explore this new side of me so much more. 
So I desperately wanted to experiment more, I was in this new scary place in my life, and suddenly felt alone in it. She's so much more nonchalant about it. I'm not looking for love, but it was really meaningful to me that it was with her. We're both super bonkers and depressed, and planning her wedding. So we were trying to develop this really close friendship/support system, but also have sex for fun. The sex part is hard to make happen. in 2 months since my first time we've done it 2 1/2 times. 
She has a lot going on, and she is struggling pretty hardcore with her own depression. we just can't match up. she'll say how desperately she wants to get her hands on me, but the majority of the time our plans don't work out, or if we're together other people are there preventing us from being able to explore more.
I don't think she's really that interested anymore, and that she isn't in a place to help me through this sexual identity journey. And I am too emotionally unstable I can't handle rejection after rejection. I want to have this with her so bad, but not at the expense of anybody involved. I just don't know how to end that side of things without breaking her. But if I keep going like this... it won't be good. I've been emptying bottles of wine and liquor, taking extra xanax and my happy pills, nothing helps. I'm trying to get into therapy, but I don't know when that will start, and there isn't an overnight fix.
I'm at my wit's end. I have 14 new, nice and long cuts on my body I'm hoping I can keep hiden.but seriously starting again I remembered how easy it was to slash one more, and another, and watch how beautiful the blood looks seeping up through the channels I created for it. I think about suicide all the time, but if I did take my own life it would be a mistake. I know that as much of a burden as I am I can't do that to my husband and parents. And hell, I have so much more in life I want to experience.  I just feel everything crumbling beneath me. 
I have been intoxicated since like 6:30 pm, and now it's 4:21 am. I took Ambien and fell asleep around 9:30pm, eventually took another Ambien and a glass of wine. I'm exhausted, but I know my brain isn't ready to let me get a break.
I just wish I was capable of dealing with my own shit, and moving on. Figuring out how to be just friends again, and be someone she can talk about her mental health issues with. It's just all falling apart and both she and my husband are either annoyed, disappointed, or angry with me (or all of the above). I feel alone, because every time I try to explain why I feel hurt, it's like some joke. Oh she's being crazy again! I don't know what is crazy or sane, or real or an illusion anymore. All I feel is fear, pain, rejection, and embarrassment.

115,2.01171875,1.431640625,-2.85546875,0,0,"Roommate is depressed, unsure what to do : My (22, F) 32 year old roommate seems to be depressed. I say ""seems to be"" as we don't really talk a lot. She tends to hole herself up in her room for days on end, only coming out to eat and use the bathroom. 
I'm not sure what to do or how I can help her as she is 10 years older than me. She is also very secretive, she doesn't like to talk or chat much. She does not have family, as I understand it she is an only child and her parents were quite old when they had her, so they sadly passed away at a young age. We are living in Europe but she is from Asia, and I've never heard of any family visiting her. I know she has nice friends as I have met a couple of them, but she rarely goes out to see them or invite them over anymore. The flat we share is one that I found a couple of years ago, so in reality it is my apartment but I got a roommate as I cannot afford it by myself. Perhaps she thinks for this reason, she doesn't need to put as much TLC into the house as I do. 
The issue I am having is the fact that she is neglecting on her household responsibilities. We live in a two person flat share, and in the last six months I have had to take care of probably 95% of the housework as well as the bills. This is something I have mentioned to her a month or so ago, the fact that I am struggling with taking care of the house by myself and cleaning up for two people and that I needed help. The split should be 50/50 on household fees (such as internet and cleaning supplies, at the moment, this is all on me) as well as general cleaning.  I know that she knows about this, and I know she knows this really irks me, but she still fails to help with housework on a regular basis. 
I've seen her mop a floor for example (less than five times probably since she moved in here half a year ago) and it is the sloppiest work I have ever seen. She will take one of those dust wipers, without putting a cover on it, spray window cleaner on the ground and mop over that. The result is a greasy, slippery kitchen floor that needs to be re-mopped anyways. Or another example, is the trash can will be full, and rather than just taking it out (we live on the ground floor), she'll just pile more and more things on top of it that the bag rips and the bin needs to be cleaned (again, by me). I'll come home late at night after work and she'll be sprawled on the couch, with the trash still not taken out. 
This has obviously led to some animosity between us. I work pretty regularly, and sometimes I'll leave the house and see it needs to be mopped and vacuumed, and while I work the whole day she is holed up in her room, I come home and nothing is done. Even something as simple as putting the dishes away when they've already been washed and dried. Sometimes even after an 8 hour shift, I am the one cleaning the entire house (kitchen, living room and bathroom) while she stays in her room. And I never even get one word of thank you. 
I don't like to confront people, and I have already reminded her several times that she needs to pull her own weight if she's living here. I think she can sense that I get extremely pissed off when she doesn't do her part of the household duties, so she hides herself in her room and only comes out when I'm in the bathroom or in my bedroom, which only makes the household tensions higher. We rarely talk, and when she does come out of her room she looks obviously depressed. Just total unhappiness in her face.
I know the depression is not something I can help with, I think even by mentioning the fact that she looks depressed to her will only sour the household relations even more. I know she will take it the wrong way if I try to offer her help. My question is, how can I make her pull her own weight in the house and help me with housework when she is obviously depressed? I don't like the current arrangement where I, as a 22 year old girl, am pulling the weight of TWO people rather than just my own. To me her supposed depression is not something that is excusable for a lack of performing half of the household duties. Am I just being to insensitive? How can I approach a roommate who doesn't even like to talk to me about this?"

During my time with depression I told myself if I ever found my way out of it that I would post my experience so that maybe someone out there who was just like me could stumble upon this and get better at least just a little bit.  So this is me sharing my story along with things that really helped me in particular.
For most of my life I would have described myself as a happy, optimistic person. Good family, good friends, good life in general. That's not to say my life was free of any emotional hardship. Specifically relevant were a couple of times I think I had a couple brief encounters with shorter term depression. In 7th grade there were a few weeks where I was very low emotionally. Feelings of not fitting in, some weird form of bullying. I remember being at my lockers when someone who was something of a friend came over and asked me if I was alright, and that shocked me into realizing I wasn't feeling alright even though I just deflected with ""I've just been tired lately."" That brief encounter kind of snapped me out of the negative mindset I was in. In that instance I think all I needed was to know some of my peers actually did care about me so I've always been very grateful to that person in a way they aren't aware of. The rest of my middle school and high school experience was very good overall. The other brief encounter was just a random day during my freshman year of college. I got back to my dorm after classes on a beautiful Friday. So much stuff that I could potentially do, outside activities with friends, online videogames with friends from high school and elsewhere, any number of campus activities. I sat down and was just overwhelmed with this immense feeling of *boredom.* All this opportunity at my fingertips and none of it appealed to me at all. In fact in that moment it felt like there wasn't anything in the world that would stop this feeling of boredom and that quite nearly brought me to tears. This actually scared me afterwards and over the next few weeks there was an uptick in me going and doing things I thought were productive and fun to make sure I didn't feel that feeling again. I was not so lucky as to avoid it forever.
Flash forward to the start of my senior year of college. I had just wrapped up a typical summer working hard, spent some time camping with my family, and was excited to be back to classes. My friends and I had founded a new club at the university, the classes themselves were engaging, and everything was going great. A couple months in and things just started to, I don't know, slip. The fun of anything I was doing just started to fade out slowly and because of this I started to withdraw from doing them. Less and less attentive with the club, less attentive with my social life, less attentive with classes, less attentive with physical fitness. By the end of the semester everything had *really* slipped, including my grades, and I just felt really burnt out on everything. I kept telling myself that winter break would be the recharge I needed. Some time to relax and refocus. Of course I didn't fully comprehend my situation at the time and was totally wrong. Over winter break I had gone back home and spent a large amount of time sleeping/resting. Even when I was awake I really wasn't doing much. At one point I had gone down for yet another nap and my mom came down and asked me if anything was wrong. She noticed the slip in my grades, the sleeping, etc. When she did that it made me briefly aware that something was indeed wrong even if I didn't know what, but I of course deflected it to just being burnt out from last semester and trying to rest up. By the end of break I told myself that I should have my energy back to really finish strong.
For the first month or two of the semester I came out swinging. I was extremely on top of everything, ahead on all my work and getting good grades on it all. Back to my normal gym routine. And yet I had this feeling that I was still just *behind* and despite how well I was doing, just unfulfilled. This was making me uncharacteristically anxious and would cause me to suddenly feel extremely tired. The tiredness led to slipping on things, missing classes and assignments more and more frequently. Eventually I had stopped going to classes altogether. Shortly after this I had started regularly crying myself to sleep, each time this happened pushing me closer and closer to calling my parents and breaking down to them. They beat me to the punch when I got a knock on my door and it was a police officer doing a wellness check because I hadn't responded to my parents for awhile. I broke down on the spot. The officer was very respectful and polite and encouraged me to call my parents, and left shortly after I called them. The next day my mom was out at my university, which was no small trip as it was 1,600 miles from home.
The rest of the week was a whirlwind that shot my stress through the roof. A lot of this was necessary, some of it felt overbearing. I remember getting texts from various people wanting to talk and feeling so exposed, as if my mom had just outed me to everyone regardless of what she actually told them to trigger these responses. She wanted to constantly be around me even though I told her repeatedly that I wasn't going to self harm and didn't feel alone (both completely true), and the lack of space didn't help anxiety levels. However she also pushed me towards all sorts of necessary meetings. With the Dean of Students, with Student Counseling, with professors, with Student Health. Student Counseling, at least at first, was somehow the least considerate of my situation. I remember that meeting clearly, the lady doing the consulting talking to my mom and giving off a vibe as if she thought I was just slacking off in my studies due to poor work ethic and distractions. She did a 180 when I actually started talking about the gradual fade of enjoyment from virtually everything, voice quivering while I was not very successfully fighting back tears, and immediately recommended me to Student Health. The doctor I met with there was much more considerate and recognized the depression right away. More tears were shed, this time from fear, as I faced the realization of being prescribed and SSRI and becoming aware of just how much my situation had escalated. With consultation from the Dean of Students, I did an All-Withdrawal, packed/stored my things, and flew back home.
The next year or so was a rough one, and contained the absolute lowest points of my life. I was a shadow of my former self. Thinking back to that time a lot of it was a blur of feeling empty punctuated by moments of extreme sadness. Even now, when I no longer consider myself depressed, simply thinking of them to type them out has me tearing up, and when I talk about it out loud my voice breaks and I can no longer hold back the tears. The spring/summer which was essentially ""family camping/get together"" season was very tough. Going on camping trips with the fifth-wheel which felt like torture as I laid trapped in a setting that I used to love now forced to realize it gives me no pleasure. Family events where I felt I was only showing up to show-face while spending the rest of the time holding back depressive tears surrounded by loving family and friends. At some point I had started therapy but I wasn't at all consistent with it. Not because it wasn't good or because I had something against it, just because depression had sapped all my self motivation to engage with it. I would still interact with friends but it was extremely taxing. It felt inconsiderate to drag anyone else down with me so I would spend a lot of what little energy I had to still interact positively with people around me. Only a few people really ever saw how I was actually feeling behind it all. I'm sure my friends loosely pieced together some extent of things but I doubt they had any idea of the full picture. Like knowing I was subtly lower energy or slightly down in mood, but unaware of the depression specifically.
 Going to sleep eventually only led to dreams where I also felt depressed. Long nights of crying from the emotional pain and frustration of my situation. Constantly asking myself ""*Why do I feel this way""* and desperately searching for a solution, hurting more and more every time I came up empty handed. Strangely enough, it was never really self-esteem involved which made it all the more confusing to me. I *knew* there were many people that cared for me, that I was intelligent, that I've had many good experiences in my life, that I had value as a person. And yet none of that mattered to me and only made it that much more frustrating to feel so miserable. There were a couple of months where I hit my personal rock bottom. I had fully disengaged from everything in my life, I couldn't even muster the energy to so much as play a video game. For about two weeks things got exceptionally bad. I was never actively suicidal or thought about self harm, but during those two weeks and maybe some surrounding them I felt to be what I consider passively suicidal. I no longer actually cared to be alive. I hurt all day, and hurt in my dreams. The only relief I had was unconsciousness between REM cycles. I wasn't going to kill myself, but the idea of just falling asleep and not waking back up, or just withering away to nothing, appealed greatly to me (It took me awhile to type that sentence because of all the powerful feelings it brings up even just thinking about it). For those two weeks I did almost absolutely nothing but lay in bed, either staring at the ceiling or trying to sleep. I barely ate or drank at all, some days not eating anything and the others likely less than 500 calories. If my parents came to check on me, I'd quickly pull out my phone and make it appear as if I was at least doing something minuscule then immediately putting it away as soon as I was out of their attention. Maybe in some way I really needed to hit this point, as shortly after began the slow climb out of the pit of my depression.
I don't know exactly what it was, maybe just absolutely crippling boredom, but one day not long after that two week period I decided to go back and play a videogame I had started but never finished. May also be in part to having decided to be more consistent with taking my prescribed SSRI (which I had not been at that point). To me this was the moment things began to improve, albeit slowly. It wasn't much, but it was infinitely better than passively killing myself. I slowly started to reengage over the next few months with very basic things like videogames and some of the online friends associated with them, with TV shows/movies, streams etc. I still largely felt numb while engaged with these things, none of it felt satisfying or truly enjoyable but it at least distracted me from some of the pain. Soon my younger sister still in high school started having late night practices multiple times a week which I would provide rides for. Because I didn't want to waste the gas to drive home just to drive back down and then back again (10 miles from the house to the school) it was an easy way to work the gym back into my schedule. Soon I was being much more consistent with my therapy sessions and SSRI use. I was engaging more with my friends. As things shifted into the summer I wasn't feeling nearly as low even if I still wasn't experiencing any happiness. I felt stable enough to take an online class to further my already almost finished degree. To me this actually highlighted the current issue I was facing at the time. I was completing everything on time or earlier, getting almost perfect grades, and not feeling exceptionally sad or stressed. However, I was extremely apathetic. An ""A"" on a paper or assignment felt meaningless, zero satisfaction where I felt it could have been an ""F"" for all it mattered to me. This scared me a lot, and I started reading Reddit *a lot* looking for all sorts of different perspectives on life/activities, desperately hoping to find one that appealed to me. And while I learned a lot in general about many different things, the true way out of my depression came from self reflection.
At some point I resigned to my apathy/anhedonia. Never feeling pleasure was a tough pill to swallow but it was considerably better than emotional pain bringing me to tears on a daily basis. Once I accepted it is when things started to drastically change, because I started treating it almost like a super power. I was just so impartial to everything that in the same vein that otherwise enjoyable activities did nothing for me, otherwise boring/tedious/demanding tasks did nothing either as apathetic boredom was the staple of everything I did. So I figured if I can't be happy I could at least be productive. Took a part time job, upped my gym/fitness routine back to normal, started to live with my grandmother whom, at 93, needed constant help around her house and with errands. She was (Passed 3/4 of a year ago now) an incredibly strong woman and one of my biggest role models, and at the same time could be incredibly finicky and stubborn to the point that she would rapidly wear down the patience of her three daughters. I've always been an extremely patient person and my ""newfound"" apathy made me perfectly suited to help her on a constant basis. At some point I had also stopped taking any SSRIs (without letting anyone know), as they had helped me get out of that extreme low point but now I had my physical energy and all they were doing was giving me restless energy with no impact on my state of mind. Eventually I transitioned from weekly therapy sessions to biweekly. I stopped drinking soda entirely, not that it was really limiting my health, I just figured I got no pleasure from it so now's the best time to drop an unhealthy part of the diet. While I still couldn't feel pleasure and that I was largely just unsatisfyingly going through the motions of life I did feel as though I proved I was stable enough to return for my last semester of college at the start of the next year. My parents and therapist agreed with me, maybe even more so after I revealed to them that I had taken myself off the SSRIs months beforehand and remained increasingly stable.
Going back out to college I had fiercely crafted a productive routine consisting of very little besides classes/studying, exercise, eating, and sleep. About 8hrs of sleep, 5hrs of exercise (Combination of yoga, weight training, swimming, and running), 3hrs of eating (To maintain high enough calories for all the exercise), 6hrs of class/studying, and 2hrs of free time per day (More free time on the weekends). Every day was packed but it was easy to keep moving as long as I stayed moving because there wasn't anything that I actually *wanted* to do that could distract me. I was also going to group therapy twice weekly, and this is something that I think benefited me immensely even now. A lot of CBT along with just being able to talk and share experience with others directly that really aided my ability to feel comfortable with being vulnerable. I became aware that *inactivity* was a trigger for my depressive feelings. Because I was so apathetic, if I ""stopped moving"" there wasn't really any motivation to ""start moving"" so to speak, which made the weekends the more dangerous days of the week. It was also a fine balance of trying to determine whether or not it was physical/mental exhaustion that legitimately required rest, or simply depressive/apathetic thoughts pretending to be the same thing. I had created a mental image of a physics block diagram that had all the factors of my internal motivation and how depression fit into that. Spring break almost caused me to slip out of things entirely due to the sudden week+ long void in my routine, and the after effects were still felt for a few weeks. Luckily the gains in vulnerability paid huge dividends with getting myself back on track successfully.
Even more optimistic, I had started to get a number of very brief breakthroughs against the anhedonia. The first one almost brought me to tears. I was finishing my last lap on the track and *really* pushed myself on the last sprint and felt a deep internal focus and drive I hadn't felt felt for a long time. I wasn't just pushing myself to be productive, I was pushing myself because I *wanted it.* I probably would have broke down and cried on the spot but I fought back the tears because I was still at the gym. The second time was during a night run and as I came up over a hill I looked over the town lights from above and at the big starry sky and felt the cool air and just had the brief feeling of legitimate happiness. Something I hadn't experienced in over two years by that point. Because I was all alone I didn't even fight the tears this time around and just let them flow as I continued my run. Another time was when I had just got done with my evening yoga and was on the way back to my place listening to some comedy online radio station. It was just some dumb joke but I actually laughed out loud at it, which stopped me in my tracks because I realized I actually *enjoyed* it. Each of these little moments were fleeting, only maybe a couple seconds, but they were so incredibly powerful to me. They are still incredibly powerful to me, I was in tears yet again just typing them out here. It truly put things into perspective for me of just how starved for happiness I was, and I clung to those tiny moments intensely.
The next and maybe biggest challenge was still just down the road. While I finished the semester with a strong GPA and walked at commencement, I still had to take a summer field course. This meant no access to group therapy. Camping out in remote locations working on stressful assignments with little in the way of all they typical comforts from home. This would last for nearly two months. I won't lie, it did make me quite anxious. It was testing a lot of skills I had learned prior to my two year break from school and it was a sharp change to go from two group therapy sessions a week to none while removing comfort and increasing stress. And really it turned out to be just what I needed. About 2-3 weeks in I was starting to regularly experience freedom from my depression. Much longer lasting moments of happiness as a more frequent occurrence. Anxiety driven by Imposter Syndrome subsiding as I started doing exceptionally well on each project. Not that my emotional well being wasn't being tested. There were nights in my tent that I had felt very low and resulted in crying. My grandmother that meant so much to me passed away three weeks into it (I still got to talk to her on the phone that same day). And even though these challenges came at me it was just more and more proof that I could process them effectively and not get caught in a downward spiral. I finished with straight A's across each section and felt *satisfaction* finally. I knew somewhere in the field course experience the grip of depression had finally loosened and I felt I was starting to get some space to live.
Flash forward to now and I feel as though that grip is gone almost entirely, save for in my memories. It's tough to say when I actually felt totally over it. Not quite right at the end of the field course but also before the last few months where my life has actually been going exceedingly well. I do know that it will always be a part of me, an incredibly important part of me at that. It's something I think about quite often, and doing so typically brings tears quite easily. But they aren't tears of sadness or feeling weak, rather tears of knowing the strength that I had to fight a war with such an insidious opponent and come out victorious. I even sometimes think now that I'm grateful for it all in retrospect, as I am so much stronger of a person because of it. That if I had the opportunity to go back to the start and magically prevent the depression from ever occurring in the first place, I wouldn't. I know my situation was considerably less severe than that of many others out there. People driven to self harm or suicidal thoughts, depression that has lasted much longer and/or that has been coupled other terrible things like abuse/anxiety/bipolar/etc. But I do think that regardless of when you find your way out of it all (And you will), eventually you'll look back at it with a strange fondness for all of the strength and growth it gave you. How positively it shaped you in the long haul, even if positivity is a far off concept for you now like it was for me. To maybe help some people along this path I'd like to share some things that worked really well for me and hopefully they can for you too:
* **Please, please, please, get help!** This is not a battle you want to be fighting by yourself. I assure you that there are so many people that want to see you get better and help you in doing so. Many can be complete strangers. For me it was my direct family, my grandmother, my friends (Even if they didn't know the extent of things), my therapist/counselors, and so many random people on Reddit I never even directly interacted with gave me crucial perspective on life when I needed it most. Speaking of, I would feel more than happy to be one of those people to help anyone struggling so don't hesitate to message me if you want to talk.
* **Vulnerability.** This goes hand in hand with getting help. You are **NOT** weak for being vulnerable. You are **NOT** weak for seeking help. Vulnerability is one of if not *the* greatest strength I have taken away from my experience with depression and what has helped me the most when fighting back against it. Just openly talking about my feelings with others in group therapy was liberating, as was openly listening and accepting the vulnerability of others. When I think back to my lowest points I felt so incredibly weak, but when I think about the moments where I vocalized and shared those feelings I feel so strong.
* **Therapy**. Undoubtedly what ultimately got me through it all. Both one on one therapy and group therapy worked very well for me. Everyone can be different though. You yourself might respond better to one type or the other, with one style of therapist or another, with a certain personality of the therapist, with a certain frequency of visits. It's important to spend the time finding the fit that works the best for you. And this fit can change for you over time. I felt like I had kind of capped out on one-on-one therapy on a biweekly basis after a certain point and switching to group therapy at 4x the frequency benefited me greatly. However I needed that one-on-one time to even get to a point where the group therapy could be beneficial to begin with. For you it might be the opposite, or it might just be wildly different. Whatever you feel comfortable with and works.
* **Medication.** The idea of being put on an SSRI was terrifying to me in a lot of ways. It crystallized the severity of my situation and the idea of taking drugs to intentional alter my mind was not appealing to me. I had an off and on relationship with my consistency taking them. It was definitely necessary to get out of the lower depths of my depression. And as my depression evolved so did my medication needs. If I was more consistent with my medication it might have sped along my journey. While going off of them towards the end was ultimately the right call it was admittedly quite risky to do that without consultation first and I would not recommend my behavior in that case. Like therapy, it is very important to find that ""right fit"" of medication, whether it is none at all or some developed combination of SSRIs you and you psychiatrist have determined over time.
* **Engagement.** As depressive thoughts would take hold of me I would disengage more and more from different things in my life. It always felt easy, even like the right thing to do, under the excuse of ""just being tired."" In reality it was the opposite, I wasn't *truly* tired, and the more I disengaged the easier it was to get pulled by depression. It was slowly reengaging with things, even if the happiness was gone from them or diminished greatly, that triggered my recovery and eventually led to moments of lucidity long term. That's not to say you should just jump back to everything in your life all at once. I know that would have overwhelmed me and cause more of a backslide. Just a gradual reintroduction of things you used to enjoy and maybe some new things you've found along the way. Maybe a simple routine and some light responsibility that you can steadily add to as you feel comfortable. Things to keep you moving and not trapped in place where depression wants you.
* **Positive Reframing.** If I had to mark the point where I really started to fight back against depression it would be when I reframed how I thought about my anhedonia. I found the silver lining to what otherwise felt like an incredibly hopeless situation. Making peace with potentially never being able to obtain happiness again so I could then focus on at least being productive. Like I mentioned before, I became mindful of it almost as a super power. I couldn't do anything to make myself happy so I no longer concerned myself with that. On the flipside I could do incredibly boring but highly productive things seemingly endlessly and not feel any different than doing something I would have otherwise enjoyed. My happiness was no longer in my direct control so I put my attention on what was, and that was productivity. 
* **Smiling.** This last one might sound a little weird, but sometimes its the small and odd things like this that can really help someone. I was doing a lot of outside work during cold winter months and was frequently wearing a facemask. At some point I started just putting an almost loony smile on my face underneath as I worked without fear of looking like a weirdo and without actually feeling happy either. Overtime it did feel as though just doing that would lead to small upticks in mood. Nowhere near happy but it added to the slowly building positive buffer keeping me from sinking back down.
So that's my story when it comes to my depression, from start to end. Doing this has been something I had meant to do for awhile now, as far back as when I was only starting to truly overcome it. Some of the most beneficial things to me during that dark time was reading different perspectives of people whom had faced their depression and come out the other side for the better so it only feels right that I pay it forward now. Anything I've spent thinking about writing this, actually writing this, and shedding tears on this would be immediately worth it if only a single person finds something even marginally useful out of it all. Don't hesitate to comment on this or message me directly if you want to talk. Discussing depression is never going to be a burden to me because I choose not to let it be so. I also encourage others like me, whom have made it out of the tunnel, to share your own experience. Nobody should fight depression alone and I sincerely hope that anyone in that fight right now who reads this realizes even a random internet stranger like me is rallied on your side."

i’ve lost the ability to feel for years and i’ve gotten so good at faking it to everyone that sometimes i can even convince myself i can feel things. i used to cry a lot because it would make me feel slightly better but now i can’t even force myself to cry. it just feels like there’s this pit in my heart and no matter what i do i can’t fill it. i’m tired constantly and i have to actively keep myself from thinking suicidal thoughts.
i was talking to a friend yesterday since we’re both in year 11 (junior year) about universities and careers. i realised something. no matter what job i do, i know i’ll always be unhappy. i tell everyone that i want to go into law and journalism to help people because i’ve always been a good helpful kid, but once i think about it, i know i’ll hate it. nothing can bring me joy anymore. no profession appeal to me and once i graduate i won’t have a true goal anymore to work towards. do i really want to keep living? 
my parents are the most amazing people and i know they’d put their hands in a fire if it meant it’s good for me, but i don’t know if they can help and if i even want help. they’re frustrated because they know something’s wrong, but they can’t change it. no one can save me. i get more and more drained every day. 
my personality isn’t even mine. i’m one of those people who don’t have a real identity and it completely changes everytime i’m thrusted into a new environment. it’s fake. i’m so sick of seeing myself in the mirror because the only thing staring back out is a shell. i used to be a person but now i can’t even look at a sink without wanting to drown myself in it. that’s why i’m so disgusted whenever someone says they like me. i feel like they only like that personality that isn’t even mine. i’m so emotionally unavailable that i play guys for fun so i would be able to feel something. i’m so disgusted with myself. 
nothing makes me feel happy anymore. i know i can’t say my death won’t affect people because i know there’s people who love me, but i can’t keep being a worthless parasite who sucks every bit of joy from other people’s lives because i can’t feel any of my own."

I started to feel like this a long time ago but it never really bothered me because I knew I was still just a kid and thought I would eventually get better when I grew older. I still feel the same as I did back then and have tried so much to get better. I wasn’t comfortable with my body so I got in shape thinking that would change my life but it didn’t. I had never been with a girl before so I started sleeping around thinking that what change something but it didn’t. I don’t even have a reason to be sad my life is normal and I have so many people who love me but I just can’t return the feeling and I feel like I let everyone down. I feel like I hurt everyone that get close to me they say they miss me and want to see me more than they do but it always feels like a chore to be around people and I just get exhausted so quickly. My sister wants to see me more and whenever we do go out I just kill the mood and she keeps telling me to stop looking so miserable but I can’t help it and when she asks me what’s wrong and how she can help I don’t have an answer because there nothing wrong I’m just miserable piece of shit. She told me once that it she doesn’t feel like she even has a brother and this made me bawl my eyes out after I left the room. My parents definitely feel the same way about me but I hardly even care about them because I’m so fucked in the head. I feel like I’m in a dream like something’s missing in my brain and I don’t feel the way I’m supposed to. It’s like I’m not ever awake and I sometimes think that this is just the way it is for everyone and I’m being a wimp, but there are moments where I doze off and I have a dream of a moment from really long time ago where I felt normal and this memory makes me feel so alive it’s like I’m awake and I feel so excited and it’s like my body turns on again and this rush of emotion gets me so excited that I wake up and the feeling goes away before I can truly get a good understanding of it. I want to feel like that all the time when I’m awake but I don’t know how or if I ever will. It was my 21st birthday today and I invited all my friends together hoping to have an at least half decent night but I felt miserable and out of place the entire time. This night was pretty much the most fun I’ve ever had and if that didn’t even make me feel good then nothing will. I don’t want to just live to keep everyone around me happy I want to live for myself but I can’t and I don’t see the point anymore I just want to wake up from this nightmare. I’m not suicidal I don’t want to die I want to live but I don’t feel alive like if I woke up and the past 10 years turned out to be a dream I wouldn’t even be shocked that would honestly make more sense. I’m wasting so much of my life feeling miserable my family keeps telling me to be happy because I’m in the prime of my life but this makes me so scared because it’s just going to get worse from here. Whatever I was really in the mood to type out how I was feeling but I have already lost interest in finishing this  so I’m just going to stop. Thanks for reading this crap I guess."

I have severe anxiety but I'm a musician so I interact with a lot of different people. I always try to be nice to people and move on with my life. I'm a private person so I don't ask too much about others and expect the same in return. So basically this dude DMs me and says he likes my music, I thank him for the support and send him an unreleased track (which isn't abnormal for me, I send my music to anyone who will listen). So one day I do a QnA and he asks me, ""How does p!ssy taste?"" This shakes me up kinda because even though I don't hide my sexuality, I keep it to myself and don't go into detail. I tell him to never ask me something like that again and says he understands, I brush it off as a one time occurrence. I decide to start to dry text more than I usually do, avoid, and distance. One day he DMs me again, and is like, ""check my story."" I tell him that there's no way I'm doing that without knowing whats on the story. He tells me he plans on dropping his ex girlfriend's nudes but tells me whats on his story is just a fight, I shut him down immediately and tell him what he wants to do is illegal. I don't click the story and I move on. The last occurrence was after he sent me a meme. I sent him a 100 emoji hoping to end the conversation naturally then out of no where he's like, ""This girl tried to send me titty pics but got mad when I said I didn't care"" Again, I shut him down and was like, ""I don't want to talk about this and I'm not the person to speak to on this."" He says he understands and is like, ""I respect that, I'm just really young so I don't understand things like that."" that freaks me out, like this dude knew I don't discuss sexual things. I just tell him, ""everyone has boundaries"". He described me as ""family-friendly"" to my face. I don't know anything about this person, he did mention something about being three in 2010 when Nicki Minaj was famous but I have no way of verifying that.
So that brings me to recent events, I end up telling him to stop contacting me (I made a public post about leaving me alone that was partially at him and to set firm boundaries) . Out of morbid curiosity I go onto his twitter. I see an Omegle chat where he claims to be 18 but who really knows, I scroll down and I see that he's tweeted out pornhub videos (which is something I don't see very often). I go onto his likes and at first it's just some sports stuff. I decide to scroll down some more and it goes from ""porn out of context"" clips to hentai, some weird hentai too like girl being roughly screwed by humanoid pig creature porn. That's when it clicks why he didn't respect my boundaries, it puts everything else into context as well. So that brings me to where I am right now. I feel conflicted. I feel like this is my fault because I didn't research who this person fully was, granted I shut down certain topics if I felt like they were going in a direction I didn't like. I handled it the best I could. I blocked him shortly after. I feel stupid and weak because I didn't stand up for myself but I just assumed it was going to end up being a one time event and the first time was a simple misunderstanding. I minimized, I'll be real. I know I sound stupid but I feel like a slipped up and let a boundary of mine be disrespected, I had just been trying to not go off on people and be civil but it didn't work. It makes me feel sick but at the same time guilty. My anxiety is telling me I did something illegal unintentionally.

Volunteered as a scribe and fell in love with the ER. The people, the pace, the environment just really clicked for me. I did what every Emergency Medicine-bound med student in the US is supposed to do. I did some away rotations, got my letters. Maybe I should have applied more broadly to more residency programs in retrospect but I applied to a substantial number of programs. M app, by all accounts, was fine. I went to a reputable state MD school, did OK on boards with solid scores and no failures, and supposedly my letters were good. Went on enough interviews that according to official data my chances of not matching were less than 3%. Made my rank list Come March 2019, and I found out I was part of that 3%. I didn't match. I was devastated. I have been ever since. I was lucky in that I was able to scramble into a 1-year prelim program. I'm currently reapplying to Emergency Medicine this cycle. On track to have the same overall number of interviews this year. Was I just a shitty interviewee last year? Did I interview better this year? Who the fuck knows. The only certainty in this hellish game is that I'll find out if I matched on March 16, 2020, and that statistically, reapplicants to the [Match](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Resident_Matching_Program) fare worse than fresh grads.

So if I fail to match again, then what? If you don't get a residency in x specialty (one year preliminary programs like the one I'm currently in don't count) you can't work as a full attending physician in that specialty. Specifically, if you don't do an Emergency Medicine residency no one will hire you to work in a tier-one city ER. Maybe I might fare better in the Match if I also applied to different, less competitive specialties like Family Medicine or Internal Medicine, but I pretty much dislike everything else in medicine and to be specific, I hate everything to do with primary care (Family Medicine) and working as an inpatient hospitalist or subspecialist (Internal Medicine). If you fail to match you get the option of imemdiately trying to scramble (called the SOAP process) into an open position, but guess what specialties most of those unfilled openings are in? Yep, IM and FM. And usually these unfilled spots are at shitty programs (there's a reason why they didn't fill, after all.) It's just doubly depressing.

I've never had a history of mental illness but the uncertainty of my future and the thought of not matching again just depresses me horribly. The more I ruminate about it the more I want to kill myself, and I certainly have the means to thanks to my 9mm handgun. As part of my current prelim year I have to do rotations in fields that have very little to do with Emergency Medicine (like my current inpatient hospitalist rotation) and to have to go to work for that every day is an internal torture for me. I'm convinced that if I find out I didn't match again on March 16, 2020 (when the results for the 2020 match come out), I will just kill myself. There won't be anything worth living for anymore. Having a medical degree without residency is near useless and to enter just about any other field would require starting from scratch with a huge pay cut too. My medical career was going so well, only for most of it to be suddenly destroyed in March 2019. We will find out if whatever remains can be salvaged in March 2020 and I get to continue on my journey to become an ER doctor.

I hate being alone. I hate feeling unwanted, and knowing everybody else just seems to be able to ""get out and do the thing"". I'm in my mid 20s, and i feel like from here i'm just going to somehow be less attractive than i already am. 
I did everything everyone told me, i lost 50 lbs and got in the best shape of my life. I've gained back some of it since i stopped having the motivation to go to the gym anymore about 3 years ago. At least i still look a lot better than i did i guess. I learned how to dress, and even developed my own style, started in retail, and have been a retail manager/stylist for 5 years now. I love the business end of it but it pretty much ends there. I did everything everyone said to make myself better, from what people have told me i'm not an unattractive guy, but it doesn't matter. I'm barely five and a half feet tall anyways which as a guy just makes me worthless anyways. I just feel like society is some crazy puzzle that i'll never fit in with or understand. 
I don't really go out because i don't know how. I don't drink, i don't smoke, i don't know how to relate to people at all or enjoy the things that people my age seem to enjoy. My friend got me back into a hobby i enjoy, and i've met a few people and gotten out more because of that, but sometimes it just makes things worse. When people are better than me at something it makes me angry. I hate that i feel like i'm only good for working and for that thing. I'm not useful as a human being, that thing is all i have. When someone, especially who seems attractive and well adjusted is better than me, i just feel like i'm useless at the one thing that i actually had. I'll start practicing for 30+ hours a week when i lose because i can't fathom the thought of losing, and what's worse is for all the work i've done in the grand scheme i'm not even that good. I hate that when someone else beats me at anything they get to have friends or a significant other that they get to go home to. They have somebody to be happy with. When they have a bad day they get to go home and tell someone about it, and feel consoled even if things are bad. I don't get that. I don't get much of anything, and even if i did......
I don't know how to not be alone. I live by myself, i've become a pretty good cook, but i only know how to cook for one person. I cooked dinner for my parents, and made for for a thanksgiving, and even though everybody said it was good, i know i can do better and none of it was as good as i am capable of. I have a really difficult time sharing my space. I'm so used to my things being mine and having me to myself that i feel like i can get upset when i have to feel like someone else is being a part of what should be mine. I feel like i will never find romantic happiness because whenever it even seems like a possibility i just push the idea away; first of all because i don't feel like anybody could love me so why even get my hopes up or try, and second because everybody seems to know what they're doing and i don't even know what i would do if i weren't alone. I don't know how to co-exist with another person in my life. 
To make it worse, i have no idea what to even do to seem like i'm even a remotely interesting person. Every time i read an article or someone wants to help me, i just get this long list of things that women expect. You have to be flirty but not too flirty or you'll seem needy. The first date has to be nice but not too nice or you'll seem needy, but god forbid you invite her to Starbucks or something because obviously that means you're boring. HOW THE FUCK AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW WHAT TO DO. Why does all of this have to be so fucking complicated? Even if i were Hugh fucking Jackman i would probably still lose out to all the guys that have all this shit figured out. Everybody wants to go out drinking and have fun and not only are most things people enjoy not fun to me, the things that sometimes make me a little bit happy can very quickly also just make me sad or become something i can't enjoy.

I’m functioning each day with a sliver of the energy, motivation, brain power, and happiness that I know I’m capable of.

I’ve been a burden to my wife, I’ve been lying to family/friends about my unemployment out of embarrassment, and every waking moment feels like torture.

I've been diagnosed for over 3 years now and as a young adult it's been hard to understand and to explain to the people close to me. 
It was the reason I couldn't continue my degree and had to move away, but also the reason I was about to live in the same city as my now husband when I moved. 
It was something that strengthened the relationship I had and led to a deeper shared trust between us than we would have had otherwise in the same amount of time. 
It inspired so many of my poems, unknowingly, in 2014 that ended up being relatable for other people, I guess.

Can someone just say 'I believe it'? I'd really appreciate it."

It kind of started midway through high school, about the time I was starting to think about college. I have two older siblings, one, my brother, 4 years older, the other, my sister, 3 years older. Around the end of my sophomore year, my brother sat down with me in my room and we hung out, and he told me about how he kind of got depressed in High School, and that he didnt want the same to happen to me. It hit me really hard, and I tried, but i couldn't stop it. Winter of junior year was probably the hardest, as it was the most I ever thought about suicide -- went to a bridge over a frozen river and sat on the edge for a while thinking about whether anyone would give a shit.
      Around the same time, my sister was being very hard on me, and to me it just felt like she didnt believe in my ability to make it to college, and that she though she was so much better. This ended up persisting for a long time, getting worse, to the point where I didnt really talk to her if I didnt have to. It peaked on a vacation, when I was upset. I slammed a car door, and my dad yelled at me, so I yelled back. Then my sister said ""what the hell is your problem"" and I shouted back, ""your the LAST fucking person I want to talk to."" Some weeks later she texted me, and we talked it over, she made up, but didnt seem to make any progress. Now we are still in a similar situation, where i find it very hard to forgive her. At this point I dont know if I'm depressed from family shit or high school shit, but I always feel like I have no one to talk to about it.
     I have a loop I go through with myself where I get depressed, dont want to talk about it, think about acting out/hinting at it to people to get them to pry it from me. Then I think ""no, you're just begging for attention"" and dont do anything, and suppress it. I know it isnt healthy, but I cant kick myself out of that pattern. My girlfriend of 3 years tries to help me by being there, but I shut her out, because I dont know how to explain how i feel. I dont know if I'm asking for help, or just writing this to try to get it out, but there. Thanks.
TL;DR:
I'm depressed, but I always feel like if I try to talk to ppl about it, I'm just seeking attention, so I dont."

I have been through most types of abuse that you can think of on a long term basis and had 2 nervous breakdowns/ major depressive episodes.
I am telling you because one year ago today I was made homeless, for the second time that month. I was *absolutely* failed by my family for the last time. 
I have been on anti depressants since i was 13 but obviously, they take some tinkering so lots of chopping and changing and no steady regulation until about 4 years ago! 
After my second NBD/ MDE my doctor tinkered one my time, giving me the maximum dose of my current medication and increasing my anti anxiety medication. This helped a lot! 
BUT becoming homeless and moving into a hostel, I hit rock bottom. Rock. Bottom. 
Suicidal thought so intense and strong but contracted by the immense love I have for my partner was torture. Like, *actual torure*. 
So I started seeing the hostel therapist. 
She gave me tools to start changing the way I think but to also go back into my memories and process past trauma. I don't know what really happened from there because my brain and subconscious seemed to just take over! 
So far we have: 
1. Regulated meds
2. Therapy
3. Coping mechanisms put in place in times of crisis
Sounds perfect right?! Like shit just *fell* into place?! 
**HELLS NO!!**
THINGS WERE SO TOUGH! The past year has been brutal! 
Speed forward to this week. Again, I don't know what happened as my brain has just been driving and *I've allowed it*.
I have been sluggish in the mornings *but* got a second wind in each late morning/early afternoon! 
I have been productive! I have left my flat! I have been wearing makeup, showering, doing my hair, going to the shops... ect. 
I was convinced I was going to eventually succumb to the torture of my brain and get so tired I'd just give in to the temptation of opening up my arms. 
When people say give it time, please try and be patient! Get frustrated, shout, cry, sleep in, leave the washing up/housework or whatever... whatever you gotta do to get through the day, do it! Because *right now* is **happening**. You need to take care you **right now You**. 
This post ended up longer than I intended but if you got this far, please remember, hard work isn't always visible. It can absolutely be internal and exhausting!!

So then it's not just depression but also terrible fear, that is, two huge problems at the same time and I feel paralyzed about it and whatever I try to do about it, like thinking more rationally about the situation, it just does not work as the feeling is too strong and I get even more scared because it does not work which makes hospitalization (etc) even more likely, and the loop continues. The only thing that ""works"" it literally doing *nothing* about it, just waiting for it to end by itself, and just trying to occupy myself with whatever I need to be doing at the time.

The strangest thing is, this kind of deep fearful depression often happens for no real reason, like if I already woke up depressed and the day is bad to start with.

So because of a family connection I can see a psychiatrist relativity quickly if I wanted to. I've had partially debilitating depression in the last 2 months or so. I tried talking to my GP about it but he suggested I could see a social worker (it really doesn't help that I was feeling ok at the time). I'm not too interested in seeing a social worker (I know some are trained in CBT). **Would I book an appointment just asking for a referral or how would that work? I've never asked for any referral much less a specific one.**
Then again my GP mentioned that my symptoms were mild depression I was having an ok day so I really didn't do a good job of talking to him and expelling quite how limiting my depression can be. Frankly, I was hoping to get a prescription for Aderrall or Ritalin just to help me push through and focus mentally but he seemed to think that having a master's degree meant that it wasn't an attention related problem (honestly though I procrastinated for both of my degrees and I only did my assignments because I was really pressured to finish college by my mom and I felt like between her and my student loans). Any time I face adversity when doing things like applying to jobs or remembering where I am in life how dissatisfied I am at never having had much of a dating life or a social life in university I am unable to function. It doesn't help that my mom thinks I'm just feeling sorry for myself and that I'm qualified to do a lot when really I'm not qualified to do much because there's no demand for liberal arts graduates and even the civil service in my country won't hire you unless you meet all the qualifications."

I've been living with these thoughts all my life and I think they will be with me until I die. : I grew up in an extremely abusive household. I can't overemphasize that. My family were refugees and my grandfather in particular was a literal war criminal.
I grew up in a violent, horrifying home. I was terrified and deeply depressed. In school I could not smile and play. I made no friends. I was bullied until I became the quiet creepy kid who people left alone.
I never connected with anyone. I failed out of school and laid down in my room to die for years. But I never died. I'm still here. I've cleaned my life up a little. I have a job and I live in my own apartment.
I disowned my family. But I am deeply unhappy and negative. No medication or therapy changes that. And I've been taking meds and seeing therapists for 15 years now.
I am a miserable and unhappy person. Few people want to date me or by my friends, and those who do are toxic and deeply disturbed themselves.
I want to die. I have no hope that anything will change. I will continue to be alone and unhappy until I die.
I enjoy nothing. I don't enjoy TV or music. I play a lot of podcasts, but I don't really enjoy them either. Having people talk in the background sometimes keeps me from thinking as much. Less chance that I fall into a pit of depression and suicidal thought.
I don't even want to be happy. I want to end.
If I had a genie and I could wish for anything, I wouldn't wish for money or love or happiness. I would wish that I had never been born.
I've had thoughts like these my entire life. They don't go away. And when I look around me at the world it all seems justified. Climate deniers are in power. We're slowly marching toward preventable disaster. I can't convince myself that humanity is good and I'm wrong for being so negative.
I think maybe if more people were cynical they wouldn't have just said everything will be okay and let the world reach the state it is in now. Maybe a little cynicism is what humanity needed to steer a better course.
Above all, I feel it's too late. I think we're all doomed and I will live a sad, lonely life until my dog dies. Then I'll kill myself and the decades long misery will end forever.
Go ahead. Laugh and downvote away. I'm used to being ridiculed or threatened with hospitalization if I open up and express what I actually feel inside.
I think one day those people who laugh or treat me like I'm sick will have to face the reality that I am living through. I think when civilization comes apart at the seams and half the world is burning there are going to be more people like me than not.
I know this is repetitive and long. It's a stream of consciousness and it's been running on repeat in my mind since I woke up."
181,0.984375,2.19140625,-2.697265625,1,1,"I’m a burden to my wife. : I keep feeling like I’m a burden on my wife. When she does something unintentionally which hurts me, if I express my feelings to her, it turns into an argument and she get hurt and out the window go my feelings and the need the address them.

That leads me to try and avoid that by not saying anything, which to no surprise ends up causing bottled up feeling that then just come out at the worst time in the worse way. 

I’ve tried very hard to explain to my wife how I feel and what would help me in certain situations. How certain things trigger me, and how they can be diffused and so on. More important, I try very hard to make myself aware of my behavior, how I read things, how I react, what I say and how I say it, and I try my best to improve. I only ask my wife for help in helping me improve. 

But there are times where she does something or says something that is hurtful, and she’s oblivious to it. And I can’t help but feel very hurt. When I bring it up, no matter if I preface it with it being just me and my interpretation of the situation, it being whatever baggage I have, saying that she didn’t do anything wrong but I’m feeling as I am and need her help and affection, it doesn’t matter. It simply leads to her shutting down, and then my feelings are compounded because I was already feeling like shit, and now I’m feeling worse because my issue didn’t get resolution, I got no affection, and now I feel guilt for making her feel bad. And in that moment all I want to do is go away and never come back. 

We had an argument today because of a misunderstanding, and I was already feeling down, but she kept making comments, as she usually does, of how she just wants peace. And every time she says that, it makes me feel as though she thinks I want war instead of peace. Which couldn’t be further from the truth. 

For some reason today it just put me over the edge. In that moment I was really hoping that I would be struck by lightning, or killed in some way, because all I feel is guilt, for making her feel the way she does. I feel like a complete burden to her. Every time it’s me and my actions or my inability to let something go that’s causing her peace to be destroyed. And I just can’t tolerate being a burden to her anymore. 

I have usually kept my desire to die or go away for good to myself. But today, I told her. I told her I wish I could just die and go away so that I would never be a burden to her again. And I meant it sincerely because she is a wonderful person, and I hate how I make her feel.

She responded by saying she’s never been so hurt by anything else that I’ve ever said. 

So I left the house, and for the first time I can ever recall, I actually stopped to look around and think this is the last time I’m going to see this house. She was in bed covered up, so I went and just said a simple goodbye and left. 

Later on we texted and it only added fuel to fire. 

I told her via text that I feel like a burden to her. And that without me she would be free, she would be happy, and she would have a peaceful life. And her response was that she was disappointed in me and hurt. 

I feel like dying because since I was a kid I’ve been a burden. And here I’m trying to tell my wife how I feel, that I wish I’d die, and It seems I just can’t escape causing her pain.  

If I kill myself, it’s going to cause her and my mom a lot of pain. For that reason alone I haven’t done it. But being myself and being in my wife’s life seems like I cause her just as much pain. I have no idea what else to do at this point. Either way I’m a burden and that feeling is just eating away at me more and more everyday."

Then our conversation arrived at a point where we asked each other what was the reason we ended up dropping a lot of our subjects and ultimately late for graduation. 
She opened up that a friend of mine harassed and bullied her nonstop until she broke down and started missing a lot of her classes. And she fell into depression. 
I broke away from this friend because of the same reason, she didn't bully me. Though thinking now, I think she saw me as someone convinient. I slowly saw this person's toxicity and attitude towards others that she doesn't see as someone she can take advantage of and I parted ways with her. 
Later on, I noticed that alot of our common friends started avoiding me; the people that I intoduced to her. Sure enough, my reputation was already destroyed by her with lies upon lies. 
Soon after I also started missing classes, and avoiding people. A lot of things fell apart in my life after that. 
After hearing that this aquintance and I had the same person that started out spiral to rock bottom, I realized how vile that friend was. 
We're both trying to recover now, step by step. Though a lot of the times I still want to end it all, I want to see this aquintance get better and find happiness."

I used to be an orphan, my father had a heart attack in 2004 and my mom died from cancer in 2005. I lost both parents by the time I turned 6. This has been the worst experience of my life and one I have accepted I cannot forget but deal with. 
There was very little caring. Every time I tried to replace my family members with the attenders, I failed terribly. Later when I was around 7 years I realized family can never be replaced. 
Becoming an orphan broke me, and shattered everything I believed in. The worst part is that no one around you understands what you go through and feel everyday. After my mom passed in 2005, I returned to boarding school and became a completely different person, without trying. I was alone, and scared. I wept everyday. I lost interest in everything that mattered to me and couldn't keep things together. I became extremely quiet and shut myself out. I started struggling academically, I couldn't study without crying or remembering my parents. I couldn't focus. I was suffering emotionally. I had no one, absolutely no one to talk to. No one in my family ever reached out to me or said ""everything was going to be okay"". I hated visiting day, because parents came over and had fun with their kids and all I wanted was to have at least one parent visit. I somehow still believed they could come back and I prayed to God everyday for hours. I became extremely religious in that time. I felt vulnerable, there was no one to fight for me, no one to love me unconditionally and I was no longer protected. I lost my trust in people and realized how selfish people were.
We always get old and torn stuff to wear and play. No one ever donates fresh clothes or toys to orphaned children. Till 11 years old I have never worn a dress of my size, always oversized, and I used to long for a rich kids birthday celebration so I could get to eat cake lmao
Whenever the attenders look at you, you have to be either studying or praying or else you would get beaten up. I remember being abused physically for being slow in certain things. Wooden spoons to the mouth if you don't finish your food or spill your food, tight slaps across the face, buttock spankings with hangar and others. There was never a day without screaming.
Fast forward to when I'm doing my SPM...I knew that nobody would adobt me at this age, and when I hit 18 I would age out and have to fend on my own. So I did my best for spm, though I didn't score straight A's, my results were decent enough for me to get in sunway.
Fast forward to when I'm 18, aged out. Just like that I'm out...I have to fend for myself. Slept on the streets on the first few days, depressed and homeless. But I didn't give up.
I was lucky enough that my parents left some money and so I used that solely for my education in college and had to figure everything else out. Like clothes, etc. I worked by teaching kids over the holidays to provide some of these cravings.
I became very independent quickly and I had no one telling me what to do. In fact, I wish I had someone who cared enough to tell me what to do. I became very emotional, quick-tempered and defensive. I put up a wall and didn't want to get hurt by anyone or anything, and avoided everything. I couldn't handle my emotions and I attributed every hurtful situation to not having my parents around. I contemplated suicide every day.
Overtime, I have felt insecure, and it's very hard for me to trust, but once I trust someone or something, there's no turning back. I have a very big heart and would do anything to help anyone. My struggles and experiences has enabled me to appreciate everything around me and wish the best for everyone. Before I  became positive, I despised the word, I was angry, and hated everyone who had a parent or was supported through life. I guess I was jealous and didn't understand why life had thrown this at me. I decided during my high school days, to turn everything around and fight for myself and my future. I knew I wouldn't have anyone supporting me, and so I was ready to battle it. I set goals for myself and till today, I take it one step at a time.
Life is still not easy, I'm facing racial discrimination in work place and in class
calling me names like K-word,robber,rapist jokingly under the mask of humour to hurt me
 but I'm not letting that affect me. If you are not my friend, I couldn't give a damn about what you think or say about me.
My experiences has made me tough. I appreciate love, even though it's difficult to love, because I'm afraid of losing them. Being an orphan sucks, it's a tough, depressing, lonely, annoying and despiteful life and takes a lot of courage to make the decision to be a better person.
However, all these experiences toughen will up anyone and there is nothing you cannot overcome because you have seen it all, have a really good heart,  genuinely care about others, and want to make the world a better place.
Last week was my first time celebrating my birthday with my friends who I call my family in over 18 years, it made me really grateful thinking about...although it was nothing grand..they still came for me. Thats why I chose to make to post to open you peoples eyes so that you can be grateful for the life you've been given.

I am moving on with my life and I do not like to be reminded, or treated specially because of my story. Have a good day and just try to smile at least once, I know its hard sometimes...but don't give up."

So I’ll just give a little background (theres not much that needs to be said really). I’m a M18 and she’s a F16 and we are about 2 months into our official relationship after talking for about 2 months beforehand. She has told me about having insecurities about her body and how she wishes for a better ______(body part like legs or waist). She has told me about how she’s had issues of comparison and feelings of inferiority with numerous other girls about body image and social standing and other things. She has told me she hates herself numerous times and she jokes about wanting to kill herself (which almost everyone does though idk i just thought I should ad even though thats a different topic entirely). She also tends to have severe anxiety (or something) attacks where her chest starts to hurt and he breathing starts getting really fast. In an effort to be there for her I’ve tried to do the following things (these are the main things i keep in mind when addressing these topics with her in conversation or in action alike):

- make it known that I am always here to talk to her at about anything at all, and that i will do anything and everything to support her when she’s feeling down.
- actually be there for her lol, giving her lots of hugs and other forms of affection. Being literally a shoulder to lean on if she needs it.
- make sure that when we talk about it I focus on her and why she feels the way she feels and just like trying to understand her feelings (and in the process of doing so allowing her to reflect on her feelings to i guess). Also making sure to try to not tell her how it makes me feel because its really not about me and guilt could cause her to maybe shut me out or something
-making sure i dont treat her any differently than if she didn’t have these thoughts so no random (“how are you feeling” etc...)
- and I’ve told no one aside from this anonymous reddit post which is also actually my first ever!

Now I’d be lying if i said I haven’t messed up with doing/keeping those things (in mind). I have talked too much in conversations about this and i have said things in ways that were insensitive to her which she has thankfully been able to forgive. I’ve kind of just been approaching this by feel and just what feels right given the circumstances presented before me. Also, this is my first time experiencing being around someone this close who has these kinds of thoughts and feelings and further it’s just a really sensitive topic as we all know. 

I was just looking for tips or inspiration or just anything that you guys think would help me in this. Any pointers on what I could say or do when she tells me about feeling about self harm or when shes down? Is there something im not doing that I should be doing? Is there something im doing that I shouldn’t be doing? I love her a lot and I really want her to be happy and not be sad or have any of these thoughts/feelings but at the same time i dont think its anybody’s job nor is it in anyones ability to change someone else but i just want to be able to do everything i can to be there for her in this.

Thanks to anyone who responds! You are all loved ❤️"

It was super triggering for some reason. I felt alone, rejected, unimportant, and like I can’t trust him to do what he says he will. 
I completely lost it. Screaming, yelling, crying, punching walls, throwing things. During my first bout of depression I remember doing that a few times but I think it was because I mixed alcohol and antidepressants. I’m not on anything this time. Maybe I need to be.

The fact remains that I’m still completely alone, and unwanted, I’ve always been alone and unwanted, and that’s always going to be the case. Literally today had to listen to a podcast say “love is human”, and it’s so true – I’m subhuman. Everyone falls in love, and has someone who loves them eventually, but at the very least by my age they’ve felt *wanted*. Even if they haven’t got someone, they’ve had someone actually want to be with them. I’ve never felt that, and I’m never going to. I’m never going to have that great first date, any first kiss – never mind that first kiss with someone you really like, not even some drunken mistake to laugh about, I’m never going to have that “ohh I wonder if they like me” feeling because I know it’s always “no”, and no one’s ever going to feel that way about me. The only thing close to this I ever have experienced, and ever will experience, is unrequited love. So many people hate the fact they’ve been single for [x] months or whatever, now imagine that being the case for your whole life, and knowing it’s your future. For those people it’s a matter of time, and for me there’s just non-stop sadness and pain knowing that I’m never going to be happy. Everyone goes on about “oh yeah single life is fun, has its benefits” but not when there’s no chance of that ever changing. 
I’m going to have to sit on the side while everyone I know moves through life as normal, not even knowing it’s possible to be like me. Watching everyone have what is totally unavailable to me, like it’s the most normal thing in the world – because it is. And as everyone moves onto more important things, and their time is mostly spent with their partners and their kids I’m going to be more and more alone socially as well. 
I just want to be wanted, it’s something everyone feels – but it’s out of reach for me. 
Someone please just put an end to me."

It’s been about 7 years now and nothing has changed other than I don’t physically hurt myself often and my mind has only gotten sicker. I just don’t know what to do I’m 18 I don’t have money to get help on my own but I’m afraid that if I don’t soon it’s not gonna end well. I’m also distant from my friends so the motive to get help is going away. Ugh.

But you wouldn't pull me up, 
You just dragged me down, 
Further into my flaws,
Not content with seeing me fail, 
Held in place, 
You hammered nails into my skin, 
Crucifixion was your despicable aim, 
Strung up and left for dead, 
Everything right in place, 
You knew what you were doing, 
But you didn't stop, 
Venomous leeches drain me of life, 
Gasping for air,
You left me stranded, 
Nothing left for the ravenous masses,
I am but an empty shell, 
Hollowed out for your amusement, 
You carved out what was left, 
And for what exactly"

flashback when i entered this job, which is my first job, and seeing a tweet about not letting anyone at work make you feel like family.
flashback when i was having job interviews after another and kept getting rejected due to my poor verbal communication skills but this job accepted me anyway.
flashback to that one person who interviewed me in my current work who is now my boss.
flashback to when i met two other people and their work team that somehow adopted me into their team as well despite my weakness.
in a way, i had two work families, despite the warning tweet i first read about not letting anyone in.
these two families somehow, at least made me forget how i don’t even know what to do with my life.
these two families somehow, made me forget a high school and a college life i wanted to forget.
these two families somehow, saw something within me that made me feel worthy of staying here.
these two families somehow, wants me to move out to another team to a client that they say would make me progress my career better.
progress my career? that’s a good thing right? but why am i crying?
no one in these two families treated me as a friend or anything close. no one of them tried to help me when they knew i has no friends. no one of them said everything is gonna be okay in a non work context. 
and yet i’m crying.
i’m not losing them permanently, but it still feels like that way.

In those 9 years I've wanted to die, to kill myself. I visualize it happening and ever since I was 13 it felt like it was destined to happen. I still think this way. I was closed off and alone my whole life, I have no social skills and can be pretty emotionally unstable if I don't put walls up and just be indifferent to everything. This helped me avoid too many suicidal ideations in high school, but when I went to college I resolved to talk to a therapist and psychiatrist, and be open and try to make my empty life less empty.
It failed, the meds did not help. I was being emotionally open and connected with people, made some friends and even a boyfriend and lost them all due to my intense mood swings and bouts of suicidal actions. I tried to kill myself twice in 2019 then dropped out of college because I missed so much class from hospitalizations. 
I shut off and I'm back to being empty and not interacting with people. I can't do it. I have no support network, I need to be alone and sad because it's more stable and less dangerous than the alternative. As I realized this and started taking classes online, I know I'll kill myself in ~5 years if I continue this way. I want to get some job, move away so my parents don't find the body, and work up the nerve to do things right this time.
Every few months I feel this want to die or to cease to exist become stronger and I'm doing nothing to fix it. Do I even want help? Do i think I can be helped? I don't know anymore. All I know is that trying to get better made things so much worse, I don't have a stable enough support network to try that again. Truthfully no one thinks about me and no one cares to talk with me, I've actively isolated myself and done a 10/10 job. 
Does it stop? Can it even stop if I don't do something different? I can't/won't do anything different so am I just going to keep daydreaming about dying as it becomes more and more of a reality?  I'm pathetic and a lost cause, and I wish every night that I just won't wake up. I deserve to be dead, the only thing I'm worthwhile as is worm food. As dumb and bad as it sounds, I either don't want help or think I deserve help/can be helped.

We started dating right before senior year and now we’re in college. I of course feel like absolute shit about all of this. I wish I could take it all back, but I can’t. I tried to kill my self after I was raped, and at times like this I wish I would have succeeded. Maybe I deserved to get raped because I was being a hoe. God I just feel so horrible and I wish I could do something about it but I can’t express that to him because I don’t want him to think I’m pulling the suicide card to make him feel bad. Bringing that shit up genuinely puts me in this weird mindset and mood for a few days. I remember back when I was so depressed that I have a lot of lost memories and things that I repressed. I remember how I felt when I smoked weed every single day because it was easier to dissociate than to kill myself. I don’t know what to do. He’s a great guy he just makes me feel like shit when he brings this up. I feel like I regress back to my 16-17 year old self when this happens."

And that's not a good thing. Depression breaks through sometimes, but it's really rare.
I don't really know why, but it's almost like I miss feeling sad. I miss never being happy. I miss being able to think about me dying, and it's weirdly hard to do that now I'm on medication. And the fact that I miss that just terrifies me. I mean, I always knew that I was a really horrible person, but was I seriously faking being depressed all this time just so I could feel special, or so I didn't have to take responsibility for my laziness and just other shitty qualities? Sometimes when I'm feeling good (for my standards) about myself I think that I am actually depressed and that me thinking I'm not is just a symptom of depression but I have my doubts about that. I don't know, I'm just so confused right now.
And then on places like this subreddit, I read about people who are really suffering and I feel like shit for not exhibiting the exact same symptoms that they do. I know there is a massive amount of different types of depression and nobody will have the same experiences, but it's almost like I use every single scrap of evidence to try to prove to myself that I've been faking it and I'm a terrible person and all of that crap. And then I feel bad for thinking that it's me just cherry-picking evidence because deep down I know that I am faking it and it's just me trying to justify it by cherry-picking evidence about me cherry-picking evidence and.... i don't even know. I feel like my brain is just completely broken
Anyway, sorry for making you read all that incoherent garbage lol.

The drugs gave me a reason to live, for more drugs, but I still had no motivation or will to do anything outside of drugs unless it'd get me more drugs.

I've  never posted something like this, but for once I've no one, nowhere and  not even the will to reach out in my personal life anymore. I have  nowhere else to turn.
I had a  psychiatry appointment today, one I've been waiting for for uite a  while, you could say I've been waiting nearly a year since being told  I'd be put straight into another mental health service and wouldn't be  left alone out in the deep end. You can probably guess where this  story's going.
The psychiatrist  heading the community service that I was in until this morning decided  to discharge me, against my wishes. She didn't allow me to speak in the  appointment. When I could get a few words in she would cut me off. She  wrote off some points that I wanted to bring up as simple personality  traits and that I can't compare myself to others, that each person is  different. Well if it were that simple I wouldn't be in the services.  She said that I shouldn't strive to label myself or something when I  brought up that I suspect I've autism. No matter how many times I said  how it's getting more and more difficult to exist in day to day life  with others I wasn't listened to.
She  told me what I thought, or what I went through. I said my last  psychiatrist dismissed a lot my issues. She said that he didn't, even  though these are two completely different services. This doctor in  particular stated that I don't have depression and the source of most of  my issues is me over exaggerating things in my head. Never got to say  that because she wasn't interested in listening to me.
From  the beginning she had an opinion of me that I felt like I was going to  have to fight against, and she never let go of it, leading her to  finally discharge me. She said that I don't appear to like the service,  that it's not beneficial, that I'm not happy with it and that I always  had something to say about it. From the beginning of my attendance to  this service I was never entirely sure of how I was being deal with. I  had a main appointment at the beginning where she had to get to know me  and my history. I was at the end of my rope at that point in my life due  to trying to finish school and being in an abusive relationship where I  was gaslit into thinking I was an awful broken person. I had very few,  maybe 2 max I think, ""check in"" appointments later where 2 different  doctors did just that, check in on me and asking basic uestions to write  down the answers to in my file. At these points in my life I was  cripplingly depressed, had no idea what was going on at all due to, yk,  trauma. My head was beyond broken and I couldn't articulate much other  than ""I feel terrible"" in those appointments. Today she backtracked on  those check-ins, that they were proper meetings, that I didn't like the  service sure I can't even make sense of what she said now as I'm writing  this. I had no appointment during the next period of my life where I  genuinely just wanted to do away with myself which is a sentiment that  has yet to leave me and has been massively exasperated from today.  One  of the doctor's even said in the meetings I've had before that there was  nothing he could really help me with because he didn't know me, that it  was a bit pointless to be doing mindfulness exercises, that he didn't  believe in half that shit. The other doctor ended up hugging me at the  end of our meeting because I was so fucking depressing. And today there  was this bitch again.
Apologies if the above paragraph isn't all that clear, I'm truly confused as to what my situation is too.
She  told me that I have no mental illnesses and cut me off whenever I tried  to say that I had no official diagnosis', just recommendations and  screenings because I never got the time of day anywhere. The only chance  that I had originally was the last psychiatrist that demeaned me. She  replied to me in these exact words: ""We're doctors, not imbeciles. These  doctors haven't found anything in you before. They would've seen  something if there was."" I had two check in appointments and that was  it. She also said that I've already been diagnosed with aspergers. I  haven't been, the child health service said it was a likely possibility  and wrote a recommendation about it in my file. I was seen very little  times because I was over 18 when they finally saw me. They told me  explicitly that this wasn't an official diagnosis. If it was, my  previous service would have known. She refused to listen and rejected  that.
I  began tearing up at some point, leading to full blown sobbing in the  end, to which her only response was (at the door to the office) \[name\]  come on, I have to move on to the next person.
I  broke down crying on the floor of the toilet inside. I couldn't go out  in public in that condition. This is possibly the lowest I've felt since  I: 1: Was left on the floor of my abusive ex boyfriend's floor to curl  into a fetal position and cry, and 2: Crying in the school bathroom and  cutting my arm after being demeaned by my principal for the sin of  reaching out for help.
This seuence of events has happened far too often for me to not give up finally, relapse into stuff or you know."

So here I am typing things out to a bunch of strangers when I should be trying to sleep. I thought about killing myself tonight.

And then this morning I was blocked on everything so.. yeah that stung. And I don’t really have many friends to lean on either so every crisis, every sleepless night, every “maybe tonight’s the night where I shut it all off” is handled by me and me alomne.

I have found out they have had a number of plans without me and I feel like they just don't like me anymore. Feeling this, I tried to make new friends, but the same thing happened even quicker with them. I have found a friend group now who are nicer and for now, don't dislike me. My mum can see I am depressed sometimes and she thinks it's because I spend my weekends indoors on technology (because I never get invited to anything), so she tries tirelessly to get me out the house and to try something new. However, most of these things I find very boring or not something I would like to do, and she gets upset and angry at me because she thinks I would rather spend all my time indoors and I am depressed because of it. This is not true, as I am completely fine with being at home for a day, or having no friends. What I can't bare is not knowing if my friends really like me or not. My mum (like I'm sure many others do) drags me to these places I would rather not be, as she thinks it is in my best interests. Not wanting to go to many of these places, I often act sad and negative when we go, which ruins it for her and makes her feel upset. I hate for my mum to feel sad, though I physically can't have a positive attitude to these things/I can't cheer up even if I want to. The same thing happens every weekend: she talks to me about this new place she wants to take me, I commonly reject it, she begs me to come out, i either go or I don't, but either way she ends up becoming sad and not enjoying her day. I feel like a failure and a dissapointment, as I have lost all my hobbies to my sadness. 
Summary: I feel like my mum doesn't understand my problems and thinks it's because I don't get out, when really it's my social issues. I tell her this, but she insists that going out is the best way to help, which I know it is. 
When she tries to find something to do I often dislike it or don't want to go, which puts me in a low mood as I'm being forced to do something I don't want to, and this ruins whatever we plan to do or are doing for my mum.

(living with my parents is a whole 'nother shit show and is the root of my depression). she's condescending and judgmental, has no trust in me, and treats me like an adult only when it's convenient for her. her husband, my uncle, is just basically her minion since she controls the house anyways. 
i'm so lost and exhausted. the only thing keeping me alive and sane is my boyfriend. i want to kill myself, but i don't want to hurt him by dying. everyday i think about killing myself and how i would do it. if one day my boyfriend and i break up, i will finally put an end to all of this."

—-context—-
I was an artist until the stress of a very toxic job and unstable relationship kind of killed my self esteem and identity as an artist. All of my dreams to be a business owner, real estate owner, and artist seem out of my reach as a poor person without stability or a safety net and realizing this leaves me with no motivation and actual dread every day. I’ve been trying to meditate on what to do: build up my floral business that people keep encouraging me to do (but I can’t even afford flowers), paint the paintings I feel disenchanted with that others love, return to a career (if I can get a job) that supports me but is ageist and sexist and soul crushing? I can’t find an answer and I feel trapped in limbo and paralysis. If money/rent wasn’t an issue things would be a lot different. I make plans as often as possible with friends but outside of that I can barely get myself out of bed. Even my bed isn’t stable as I can’t afford my rent. I’m working freelance for my bf and he’s and paying for NF so I have this rare opportunity to turn it around.

I know,  I sound like a child.  Unfortunately I'm very much an adult, something she started saying the second I turned 18, and has continued to say ever since.  It was never a good thing,  btw.  She views me as just someone who can no longer expect anything of her.  She checked out emotionally many years ago,  but that was when even the basic stuff,  she stopped doing.  
I understand most people aren't as close to their parents and probably wouldn't understand why I take this so hard.  The truth is that I went through some awful shit as a child and my mother was the one I could (usually) rely on.  We had a strong bond- she raised me all by herself, just the two of us.  She had me young, so we were often more like best friends than mother and child.  
Which is what made it so painful for me when I was going through a really awful time with my mental illness and she abandoned me as a teen.  
I don't think I've ever really recovered from the emotional abandonment. Most likely because I never really admitted that she doesn't love me all that much.  She loves her husband, and my little brother, and she loves her mom, and her friends, and her dog.  
She does not love me the way she loves everyone else in her life.  It's not that she doesn't love anybody,  it's that she doesn't love *me in particular.*
I'm a broken toy, one she doesn't care to fix, one she'd rather throw away.

He goes on to talk about ""The will to live"" and I interpreted his writing as your lifeline/attachment on this Earth is on a spiritual level to some deeper meaning to life, whether it's finding purpose in work, family, dog dad, etc, but automation/robots has replaced many of those roles, so now we don't know what to do with ourselves but be bored and depressed about it. And imho, it's gonna get way worse before it gets better, and ""better"" is incremental, given what we know.   
It's ironic to think that society is trying to upend gender roles/norms (for good and for bad maybe), but I am starting to realize they were instilled for a very specific purpose. Before it was like ""This is your community's intended purpose for your life"" and people walked that path, knowing their suffering had meaning. Now we've created a society where we try to avoid ""suffering"" but then our lives begin to lose meaning. I think it depends on what KIND of suffering (like, central AC or electricity) is different than being in a caretaker role, etc.   
Just wanted to share. It's given me a lot to think about. What role do I play? What purpose does my life have?

•Loss of interest in all hobbies, and my passion in life is all but snuffed

•Trouble sleeping and staying asleep, always tired and have little energy

•Often easily irritated/prone to anger/hateful momentary thoughts

Hi everyone! I finally decided to join reddit and hope that I chose the correct subreddit.  
Maybe some general info: I am a 23-year-old female student. I was diagnosed with depression last year (have had it since I was 15, but I never took it seriously unfortunately, thought I was just lazy etc, last year I finally decided to get some help as I was barely functional…) Anyways, I started CBT some months ago and while it is not bad, I wanted to try something medication-wise, but I am very sceptical about SSRIs which are still the first line of treatment. I read about methylphenidate being used off-label sometimes in depression and wanted to try it because of the depression and the concentration troubles I have had for a very long time. I got a small amount of 10 mg pills from someone (no, not a doctor...) and tried one yesterday. I started at 5 mg, after a while I felt my surroundings to be a bit “dimmed”, but no improve in focus, so I took the other 5 mg. Then I got calm and relaxed, my anxiety (which I had not really noticed before) was gone and after the effects wore off, I felt like I had just done something very relaxing and fell asleep. Nothing productive done during the time it worked, unfortunately.
So today I started with the full 10 mg pill. Nothing. Not even side effects (yesterday I had cold hands and some thirst). I took another one an hour after the first.
I got a bit calm again, but barely felt the difference, then tried to meditate. I then took another one, again nothing!! Just feeling a bit sleepy now.
Could someone maybe comment on why I reacted like this? I know it would be only a theory but I am very curious. I will give back the remaining pills I have and do not intend to try it out more, as I feel at 30 mg I should have noticed something. I know that ritalin only inhibits the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine, so maybe I was low in them in the beginning? I would be willing to try maybe wellbutrin or a MAO inhibitor, but I doubt I can just get them “on demand” (whereas I would easily get an SSRI etc.)
I feel like what I experienced yesterday sounds more like what medications that work on GABA do. 
I know that self-medication isn’t the way to go but given the fact that ritalin wears off so quickly I just wanted to give it a shot, mainly because of depression/focus issues and high distractibility. I know that it is “abused” by students for more focus etc. and I would have loved it if it worked like that, but I really can’t see how from my experiences :D. Also, I do not react to caffeine anymore, I remember my first cup of coffee as well as my first energy drink, I was so alert and calm/could order my thoughts better. Even after some weeks of caffeine abstinence I do not get these effects anymore.
I will probably go to my GP soon and also talk to my psychologist; I am just curious if any of you have had similar effects (without having AD(H)D).

I am an anxious person. I love to look down on myself and think the worst, so how I deal with it is to make myself busy with life. School and side activities, part-time jobs and partying. But now that I’ve had extra time I get remembered of demons and all the reasons why I think I am a failure.
First, I get so surprised and jealous of people who have a good relationship with their siblings and nieces. I have four siblings, one of them passed away last year, and I have seven nieces. I am the youngest in my family so the age gap between us is huge since I came into the picture rather late. My relationship with my siblings is non-existing, and not because they are bad people or anything, we were just never close. I also live in another city than them which doesn’t make it easier to get in touch. I feel like I actually don’t know anything about them, and they know nothing about me. I don’t know what kind of music they listen to, what they like to eat or what their dreams in life are and same can be said from them about me. And the thing is I really do want to get closer to them, but I get so anxious around them and I can’t relax. I feel like a personality-less person who doesn’t even know how to talk to my own fucking siblings, and this fucking breaks my heart because I have this barrier that won’t let me just be calm and be myself. The only thing that helps me take down that barrier is alcohol, and anxiety and alcohol doesn’t mix well together. But I love the feeling of losing the barrier that helps me talk relaxed to people, the feeling to just make friends with the whole wide world. But the day after a night of heavy drinking comes the anxiety that won’t let me leave the bed and I won’t even open my phone for HOURS because I always have this fear of finding something horrible when unlocking the phone, even though I KNOW that there isn’t anything bad there.
When I’m feeling my worst this anxiety won’t let me open chats in messenger, the whole app just makes me anxious, the mere thought of someone wanting to get a hold of me makes me want to throw the phone in the lake and take a flight to a jungle were no one will find me. My mailbox, both email and at home get filled because I have the fear of finding something I won’t like. 
I, like maybe most people here, feel very lonely since I don’t have a relationship with my siblings nor with my closest friends. I wish to find love, to go on tinder dates or just fall in love with someone from school.
But I always tell myself that I’m not enough for anyone and that I am all too boring for anyone to find interest in me, and to go on a date and get rejected just scares me too much which then leads to me just not going on any dates at all. But I have had guys showing interest in me, but I get too scared and push them away by telling myself that we would not match and last anyway, or by going home together after a night at the club and not being able to handle the situation afterwards. And then being left with my thoughts and convincing myself that it’s for the best because I like being alone anyways. 
Friends. I’ve met a lot of people in my life, but I’m not very good at keeping them in my life. People try to get into my life but I get uncomfortable and either ghost or get annoyed by them and just wish them to get out of my life even though they are good people. Or when I’m with people I actually do like I get scared that I am too plain and boring and not too exciting for them to stay with me. I get this anxiety and start to pressure myself to present myself in a way that will make them interested in me, kinda like if they are a crowd at a theater and I am the actor that needs to keep them entertained so that they won’t leave the salon. That Is why, if I don’t get invited to one smaller thing or don’t hear of something they all seem to know I take it so fucking personal even though they didn’t even mean to not include me. But since I am so unsecure about myself it tears me apart and I start to question myself, my worth and what the fuck I am doing on this planet. I suck at calling people or asking people how they are.
Maybe someone can relate, but writing this out calmed me down a bit and I hope that I will find the strength to come back to this thread and read the possible comments (if anyone actually reads this wall of text, sorry!) because anxiety. 
Lots of love from this anxiety filled blob."

But i noticed i suddenly grew an interest on one of our kitchen knives, not like to hurt people, its just an odd interest where you imagine the knife killing you painlessly.
But the thing is, i have a phobia of sharp things so i grew up cautious with sharp objects including knives... Its not really bad, i just do stabbing motions on myself, but the point is i consider doing that normal.
I also keep daydreaming while walking and oddly enough i daydream about me getting in a car crash or something similar, which i has a  high chance of happening considering im daydreaming.

Why am I paying someone for something I can get from random people online oh wait that’s right my anxiety &amp; depression “solving pills” that come with there own set of problems but again I don’t really need a therapist for that my own family doctor can proscribe those so why am I wasting money on this shit it’s so frustrating the therapist is only really there to in a roundabout way tell you to solve your own shit in a healthy way. But who came up with what is healthy for me I just want to cut loose and break everything in her office smash every piece of glass and rip everything thing apart and maybe during that moment maybe if only for a small amount of time I will forget. Forget those around me that left or those that are dying that I can’t help or those who for reasons can’t even remember my name after knowing me my entire life. But that’s not a healthy way to really deal with my problems I guess or at least that’s what she tells me.

371,0.053436279296875,2.4609375,-2.048828125,1,1,"What's the point of still living? Why haven't I killed myself already? Is anybody gonna read this post anyway? : So many questions, yeah. I think it'd be good to answer them in the order in which they are written. To introduce myself. Hi, my name is Anne and I kinda do like blueberries but that's not the point of this post, so let's get straight to the point.
What is the **point** of still living (see, I told you we would get to the point)? Many people I know have their future already planned. Which is the best thing that could happen to a person really. You just wanna know where you're going in life. What you wanna achieve. Which job you would like to do one day. Like, everyone of my friends has seemed to know these kinds of stuff for such a long time that it's kinda making me even more depressed. You see, I'm not 18 anymore. I'm turning 25 this summer. This fact is totally crazy cause I'm just way too old for someone that has been wishing to kill herself for such a long time lol.
Which brings me to the second question: Why haven't I killed myself already? Great question, really. The thought of killing myself has been in my mind for quite a while actually. Ever since I got bullied during the elementary schoo, I wouldn’t make a day without thinking how liberating and relieving that act would had been. My life was so shitty at that time that the thought of killing myself one day to end the suffering became the only solution that felt right.
This whole situation became so bad that I started seeing a therapist. Which, at this point, I’m quite thankful for cause if it hadn’t been for him and the pills he had prescribed to me, I wouldn’t have even made it to the end of high school. I was sooo determined to kill myself really, the suffering was just unbearable. Yet, I didn’t do it in the end. But we’re about to get to that later.
And, I mean, I am the one to blame partly. I have a really unstable personality and it surely is really hard to love me or be my friend. I generally am really kind to people and let them do any bad thing to me if that means they'll still be by my side. It is terrible doing so, I am quite aware of that. But I am often feeling really lonely because of my shyness and social anxiety, so when I start trusting someone, I really am afraid of losing them cause I know I ain’t gonna replace them that easily. 
Like I said, I am hard to love. I don’t think I’m worth anything to be honest, so I’m always really surprised when anyone actually approaches me and seems to like me. My therapist would have been so upset if he heard me say stuff like that but that’s just how it is. I stopped seeing him quite a while ago when I thought I’m over all this and don’t need him anymore btw. But I guess that I was wrong.
One day, I feel amazing and really happy about my life just to get all depressed and sad the other day (or even the same day, only a couple of hours later lol). I just let myself be hurt by people. Over and over again. Cause it's my fault. On one hand, I know it’s wrong but I just continue letting them do that. I just let my boyfriend treat me like shit sometimes. Cause it's my fault. Plus, who else is gonna love me if he leaves me, right? I just have to endure that. It hurts. But you wanna know what hurts even more? The fact that I can do nothing about it.
I’m too scared to be lonely. Some days, I feel like my boyfriend genuinely loves me and cares about me and everything in my life is great. Other days, I just feel like shit, starting to think that killing myself is not that bad of an option after all. It is a great option indeed, yet there’s a tiny little problem. I’m way too scared to do that. If only I had no self-preservation instinct. That shit always stands in my way. It always  felt so right to kill myself but my self-preservation instinct always stood in my way. I am just way too weak.
So here I am. With no future ahead, having to be quarantined because of the corona virus pandemic, which makes my depression ten times worse. I don’t know how long it’s gonna take before I can at least leave my house, but one thing’s for sure. I feel like there’s no future for me and I see dying soon as the only option again. But I'm scared to do that. Again. 
I am pretty sure that I'm gonna feel better tomorrow and this won't be that much of a problem anymore, but that is what scares me even more. Thoughts like this are always gonna be somewhere in my head just waiting to fire their shot (this expression is probably not used right, but that doesn't matter cause my whole life is trash). And I'm just too scared of the next time they'll come to haunt me. My life is a fucking rollercoaster and I don't find it funny anymore.
Is anybody gonna read this post anyway? **Excelent question**, thanks for asking. I don't know. But I feel better having written this down. I don't know why lol. But I just do. So thank you, reddit.
If you did read it till the end though, please don't judge me. I have done that to myself way too much already. I'm gonna cry myself to sleep. To wake up feeling quite fine. Thinking I could handle my life and feel happy again, only to experience the same thing a few days later. Over and over again. Till the day I die."

Long story short I’m depressed and a little bit anxious and have been on cymbalta the last 3 or 4 years. On 90mg a day for a while then I did a lot of work on myself last year and lost some weight and dropped to 60 and then in November to 30mg (all this was discussed with my psychiatrist btw).
So I saw him maybe 3 weeks ago and we decided to try coming off entirely. So for the first week I was taking one every other day but now haven’t had one for maybe 5 days.

And so that’s the backstory, but my questions are about side effects from coming off them. I just feel really down and emotional at the moment. And I’m really hoping it’s just a temporary thing as I get used to not having meds, and that this isn’t just what I am like off the meds entirely :/ 
Specifically I just feel really sad and down and lack of energy but not like sleepy. It’s more of a sadness then just depressed. And a little bit of anxiety. I suppose it doesn’t help that cause of the holidays I’ve been drinking a bit and eating really unhealthily. 
But anyway I gues the main question is - is it normal to feel this way when coming off antidepressants and is it just temporary? Has anyone else come off cymbalta - what was it like for you?"

I'm 16, an average highschooler, but I can't enjoy my life like other ppl my age usually do. I go panicky whenever I think that soon I will be an adult. Mentally I feel like i'm twelve. I'm doing pretty great at school, I'm this kind of nerdy kid who is called smart by the teachers, but irl I feel super lost. I just want to stay kid forever and play pokemon on my DS, I'm not scared about getting a job and having to pay bills, it's not the case, I actually want to work in IT. It's just that I'm not ready for a romantic relationship, I get amused by really childish stuff, despite being kind of smartass I'm very immature emotionally, I just feel like my body is aging by my mind stays the same. Due to that fact I cry pretty much everyday. Whenever in some show, game or anime there's a character who's a kid I just have a breakdown and get super nostalgic and cry. I have this vivid memory of me being like 12/13 lying in bed at night and crying because someday I will turn 18, I'm getting closer to being 18 everyday and I just don't want it to happen so bad.

My dad, over the course of a year, has given me a total of $10k to pay off debts and just generally pay bills ($4k last summer and 6k recently). Out of nowhere, I spiraled into a depression. I've had some pretty bad anxiety for awhile, but as soon as he gave me that second loan, I spiraled out of control with guilt, which quickly turned into a severe depression/anxiety. I have already gone through my 2 weeks of PTO (and more). I can't go to work because I feel like I have the flu all the time, and now I'm scared of being able to able to pay back the loan, make rent, etc. Every day of work I missed just made me feel worse, but the thought of going made me crazy. ""*What is happening to me? Everyone is mad at me, I'm such a disappointment"".*
Every day is a struggle for me. I love my boyfriend, but I feel like my depression is pushing him away, my co-workers are mad at me, and you sure learn quick who your real friends are during a major life change.  I've lost several ""friends"" over the past year, and obviously my ex in-laws are all upset with me - understandable since I was the initiator of the divorce. I also had to leave two cats behind which were my world (sounds silly, but they were). 
Basically, the guilt just eats away at me. I am one of those people that can't stand the thought of people being mad at me or not like me. I cannot just brush it off or say screw it. I care ***too*** much what people think. People that don't even matter to me or have no significance in my life. I think *way* too hard into the future, and worry about everything that hasn't even happened yet. ""It's like I'm trying to control, and protect my future self from getting hurt somehow but I don't even know what those things are. So much so that this why I've been missing work because I was so anxious and depressed that I could not fathom eating, which was making me sick...I can't go to work, can't pay my bills, will get kicked out of my place, my boyfriend will move on, will lose my car, will have to move back in with my parents, and be lonely, sick and sad forever. I will just be known as that ""sick girl"". This is the way my mind spirals out of control on a daily basis. I've seen a psychiatrist, a therapist, had multiple visits with my doctor, so now the doctors bills are going to start piling on top of it. 
Currently I am taking 50mg of Zoloft, which has been beneficial to me in the past (roughly 2014), but I stupidly decided to ween myself off of it around the same time I started going through a divorce. Like I wanted to prove to myself I could handle all of this on my own without the use of medications. *Wrong.* 
I was also taking around 10mg of Ambien every night for sleep and it worked great for me. I had no side effects whatsoever. However, I started to run out way to early. I was sleeping a lot and napping so I'd break them into pieces to take naps. The doctor became alerted to this during our last visit and refused to refill it for me, which of course, sent me into a literal tailspin and severe panic. I was throwing up when I left the office because I was so distraught (and still hadn't eaten). My mind went reeling thinking ""how am I going to function and handle all of this stress if I can't ever sleep, how can I work?"" Literally thinking I would die eventually from exhaustion and depression. My psychiatrist then prescribed me 15mg of Remeron, which seems to have been working ok but it's just not the same. I hate starting new medications. I went through all the classic symptoms, sadness, anger, etc. My parents, boyfriend's parents, my siblings, boyfriend, all started to become worried and concerned for me which made me feel worse. I just feel like I'm going to ""run out of time"" as I keep saying. Basically, that everyone around me is going to abandon me before I have a chance to heal.
This week, I'm back at work and have been sleeping somewhat better and doing my best to stay positive and just focus on work, pushing past the feelings and just trying to enjoy my life day by day instead of trying to fix everything. Of course, my mind is still reeling and I'm still not feeling great, but taking baby steps. Does anyone relate to any of this? Thanks"

From as young as I can remember, I’ve been treated badly by fellow humans. It started off with pinches on my hand, then those turned to slaps, then kicks, then strangling and the belt, then punches and hair pulling me meters across the floor. Then there was the constant verbal attacks that I still get. It’s like I’m under a gunfire of insults constantly when I’m around my family. It’s like I’m a disgusting person. 

Then middle school and high school came. I started to get bullied with the typical “you’re so fucking ugly f*gg*t” insults. Then those progressed to full blown harassment (physical intimidation, following me around, receiving anonymous texts with insults calling me every name under the sun and threats to get me expelled). Finally, I was basically expelled from school due to the principals son being involved in the bullying and how corrupt the school was. I technically dropped out of school before I was expelled, mainly due to the huge mental breakdown I had and the fact that I started to suffer from major panic attacks at school. I had to get my mother to eat lunch with me as I was physically scared to be alone, scared of what would happen. Then she stopped, getting mad at me and telling me that I was neurotic. 

Then I moved out of home at 16 due to being so unhappy there and rejoined school again after a year of being a flunk. I still had deep scars and as a result people saw me as weak and vulnerable so I started to get picked on there. I isolated myself before anything else happened and I was a complete loner. I put all my effort into my studies but didn’t get the grades I needed for the university I really wanted to go to as one subject I took really, really messed up on writing the exams. Also, I was dumped by someone who meant a lot to me because I was “revising too much and not spending enough time with them” and my grandpa died who was one of the few family members who actually cared about me. 

Then university came. It seemed like it was going well at first, until I started struggling financially to the point where I couldn’t even afford bus fares. Then I got taken advantage of and sexually assaulted. Then there was an incident where someone told everyone I accused someone of rape and spread that I slept with that guy, which were both lies. Now I’m known as a sl*t in my dorms and I get really dirty looks from people because they think I’m an attention seeking liar too. To make it worse, the friends I made are distancing themselves from me and I have gotten very sick to the point where I’ve been in bed for a month. 

I got sick because the guy I was dating gave me a disease. This guy emotionally abused me, basically alluding that I was dumb as f*ck and that other girls were way hotter than I’d ever be. I broke down. I dumped him but he hurt me so much. 

Now I’m alone. I’m sick in bed. I was attached to a drip for 2 weeks straight. I don’t feel like I have much going for me in life, if anything at all. I feel like I don’t really have anyone at all and guys see me as prey and use and abuse me. What’s the point of carrying on when the universe hates me? I should have ended my life by jumping in front of that train last June like I had planned. 

I’m ugly. It’s horrible looking at myself I’m the mirror. I’ve lost so much weight from this illness and basically sleep all day now as this disease causes chronic fatigue. I should just leave this Earth now."

Starting my first ever SSRI (Celexa) this weekend. Also on Buspar. Could use some input.
After being on Buspar for a few months, it’s helped my anxiety to the point where I don’t really have panic attacks anymore, and my general daily anxiety has subsided a bit. But I’m definitely not 100%. Even though the anxiety is subsiding, I still don’t feel ‘normal.’ In fact, I’ve felt “blank” for years due to anxiety and depression, my baseline is quite low. I don’t really know what it’s like to feel ‘normal’ or 100%. I’m just used to dealing with it day to day. I told my doc all of this the other day while checking how the Buspar was working.
When I look to my future, I don’t really see one. Not because I’m suicidal or anything (thankfully I don’t have those thoughts,) but because it just feels like I’m living day by day without much projection in my life. I go to work, go home, and my social life is really bland for a 24 yr old guy. 
The doc said that Depression is definitely comorbid with my anxiety (you don’t say!) and prescribed be Celexa. I’ve never been on an SSRI, the only med I’ve ever been on regularly has been Buspar. I’m a little nervous to start it, for some reason. I’m supposed to take my first dose this morning. Doc said the only side effect I’ll probably run into is drowsiness. She specifically chose Celexa because apparently it has less severe side effects when compared to Zoloft for a guy my age.

This year has been probably my toughest ever. I've been trying to come to terms with the ending of a really special friendship between a couple and I, a whole group of friends due to lies being spread about me that included my best friend I made on the fetish scene and two friends died, one to suicide and one to a heart attack. I was made redundant from the first job I have had last longer than a year and a half since 2008 due to moving my role outside of London, I've had problems and uncertainty over my living situation and culminating in my Dad having a heart attack about two weeks before Christmas.

In the last six months, I've I purposely asked my therapist to start trying to help me come to terms with my own abuse, but unfortunately, my own mental health went down the more we spoke about it. This was around June time and around that time I met my now ex play partner. As I am on the fetish and BDSM scene, having a play partner is kind of like a FWB but you meet up, hang out, ""play"", have sex, whatever... Problem being, I pretty much fell for her the moment I saw her.

She is everything I want in a partner, funny, cute, curvy, into the same music (BIG BIG THING for me) and into the same kinks, even the ones I am ashamed of / scared of sharing with others. She always said she wasn't over her ex and didn't want anything serious but with her being exactly what I want in someone, I couldn't help but fall for her. She is literally only the second person ever in my life that when I met for the first time, my heart skipped a beat and I felt like my jaw dropped like a Tex Avery cartoon wolf.

She pulled away from me twice through kink guilt and then the final time happened in mid-Oct, I didn't realise how serious it was and how much it really was over for a few weeks afterwards when she told me she had feelings for someone else. This was the lynchpin that when it was pulled away, started my breakdown. I broke down to my housemate's girlfriend and sobbed my heart out so hard and for so long, my other housemates came to find out what had happened. I ended up in such a panicked state, I had to call the Samaritans for help. I ended up calling a few different helplines to try and get somewhere but it didn't amount to much.

I ended up going to the Accident and Emergency (ER to the US readers) because I was so low, I was worried I would do something stupid. They didn't do much but eventually, they referred me to the brief intervention team... which I only heard from after a series of shitty and frustrating events. I have spoken to doctors and spoken with a clinical psychologist now and they've referred me to a psychiatrist but STILL waiting on this too.

I still talk her occasionally but she's super short in her answers and it just hurts. I've only seen her once to give her belongings back, but any time she puts on update on the website we met through or her IG, I get anxious and upset, but I can't unfollow / delete / block because something in me isn't ready to let go. She's everything I want in someone I just can't bear to think that I could miss out on being with her. We'll end up running into each other at some events eventually but I know I will have to leave because it will hurt too much.

I honestly don't know what to do. I'm lost, so lonely, I feel ugly, I'm overweight and no one wants to be with me and no one EVER wants to be with me how I want to be with them.

Since I broke up with my wife at the start of 2015, I have had about eight partnerships but none were anything serious, no matter how much I wanted them to be. It's been ten years since I have felt like I was getting what I needed from a relationship and I'm lonelier that I have ever been. I have some better tools to cope with the down times that I did before but I'm still hurting so so much and I just want a ray of sunshine, someone that makes my heart skip, someone to show me the love I want to give them, but no one I want to be with, wants me, they never have and I feel like they never will.

I was a really late bloomer in school and I didn't start having relationships till I was 15 plus and then didn't have consensual sex till I was 17 plus and the only reason I did end up dating people and such was because they were the first people to come along and show interest in me. I honestly ended up in relationships with people who were bad for me from the start for the pure reason that they showed interest and somewhere in my \*\*\*\*ing brain just went ""QUICK! DON'T TURN THEM DOWN! YOU'LL NEVER GET ANOTHER CHANCE, NO ONE ELSE WILL CARE!""

I'm just so so tired, so lonely, so upset and so scared that I'll never be happy again. I don't want my Dad to die before he know I have someone who loves me and I love them. My parents are in their 70's now and they are starting to show real signs of aging and losing either of them could really be the end of me.

Sorry, this post has gone all over the place, just very tired (mentally) and just want someone there to hold me, to give me a kiss, gently stroke my back as they pass me while out with a group of friends, just anything to know that someone cares enough to touch me. I need contact with people, if I were to see friends 99% of the day for a week, but had to physical contact, I might as well have been alone, because I need it to fell like someone cares and right now, no matter how many screenshots I save from those that reply to my posts, no matter how many phone calls, whatsapp's or whatever, nothing can replace that contact, especially from someone that I want to be with and they want to be with me

Yes, I'm at this age where most of my friends are in relationships. People might describe me as being in the ""prime of my youth"", but if this is the best it's going to be I'm afraid for what comes next. And then there's me. I've never been in a relationship, in fact I've never really had intimate connections with another person before. Honestly, I don't know how to. 
I go through each day as if nothing's wrong, but deep inside I'm  lonely.  And I truly wish that I could have someone who really understands me and will love and accept me for who I am. My friends tell me it's better to be single because being in a relationship comes with a host of its own problems. Others tell me that I just need to be patient, because things will work out eventually. That there are plenty of fish in the sea, that it's just not my time yet, that it's not something I should worry about. You name it, I've heard it. And I agree with them, because for all I know they could be right. But in light of all this, I still don't feel happy.  When most people that I know are in relationships now, and I find it difficult to even connect with people, I can't help but feel like I'm not good enough. Like I'm not worthy. Like there's something wrong with me. Because if there isn't, why is my life like this? 
So yes, I say things like ""I wish I had a girlfriend."" Because I don't want to feel like shit any longer. I don't want to feel like there's something horribly wrong with me. It's not because I want to be like everyone else, it's because I want to feel like I'm worth something."

I've lost all my confidence from many things, but mainly being bullied by others growing up and my parents divorcing and their conflicts for 6 years while I was living with both of them. I guess I just feel unloved. I feel like I can't turn to anyone anymore. To be honest, I don't like myself. Every day when I'm with my close friends who I met in college this year, the only thought going through my mind is that they're going to eventually leave me because it seems like that's what all my friends have done before college.
I put my whole heart into any platonic relationship I have, I try so hard to be a good person and make others feel loved and appreciated and I feel like it gets me nowhere. I recently opened up to my (best?) friend in college about how I feel about myself. Now she's starting to distance herself because she says she doesn't want to have to constantly be thinking about and worrying about me. And while I understand that, it hurts. Because if I had friends who were like that, while I would be worried I would still want to be there for them because now I just feel alone and I feel like I have to keep everything even more bottled up than I have.
I have all these thoughts inside my head and it feels like they'll never go away. I feel stuck and I don't know what to do and it scares me because now I feel like I've been driving everyone away and it makes me hate myself even more because it makes me feel like I'm not loved for every part of me, just the parts I choose to show.

* Poor sleep pattern
* Poor hygiene
Each for a reason, for example when someone says how are you ""tired"" is an acceptable answer. No more question.
Poor diet and hygiene are to increase the likelihood of getting an illness that hospitalises me and also helps me feel on the outside like I do on the inside. But does any one realise what is going on? Nope, not even the folk I live with.
So with all of that I have become more susceptible to sickness which mean I could(relatively easily) catch the dreaded C word (not that one). And I'm excited not scared. If I get sick and die then it doesn't matter cos that's a natural thing, life goes on with out me and without blaming me."

I know that I enjoy studying and I do have many other goals I want to achieve (such as exercising regularly), but I can’t seem to translate them into actions. 
I suspect it started due to a burn out. When I was 13-15, I did well in my exams and it felt good so I really enjoyed studying. Hence, all I did was to study all day. Approaching a major exam, I think I started to burn out and I sometimes just laid on my bed and used my phone when I should have been studying.
This went out of control when I entered high school. There was a steep learning curve, and everyone around me were smarter than me. Studying became less enjoyable, and my tendencies to stay in bed all day doing nothing became stronger than ever. Looking back, those were really hard times, my mind was literally telling me to study but my body wouldn’t budge an inch. 
I thought that it would be over after I have finished my exams, but unfortunately not. At first, I tried very hard to get out of this situation. I worked hard to find a job during my break, and started journaling. However, such progress was only short-lived. Even though I managed to get a temporary job, everyday when I reached home and on weekends, I was one with my bed. Now that I’ve received my results, I’m even procrastinating with my uni applications. 
My parents were very strict and controlled my life for the first 13 years, so i don’t think i was given the chance to develop my self-discipline. 
I’m not sure if I have issues with my self-discipline or if i have any mental illnesses. I have many goals for myself, which I have written and typed so many times in an attempt to kick start my momentum, but they never materialise. I am normal at work (except maybe a little lack of self-confidence), but off work I literally do nothing useful. 
Can someone help me analyse my situation and also provide tips on how I should proceed from here? I would really appreciate any help, thank you!"

I don't have a therapist at the moment - I'm working on it, on a waiting list but now medicated and taking steps to get out of the house and all that - but I need support and I want to ask my friends for some. 
Friends aren't therapists, and I know this. Frankly, I'm terrified of treating my friends as therapists so I have a tendency to bottle things up until, surprise surprise, I am a mess and need to ask for help. I can, for the most part, function on my own. I get up, get dressed, drink my coffee, drive to school, etc on my own, but sometimes I just need someone to *be there*. Not talking to me or having to give me physical contact or anything, just kind of exist in my vicinity. 
Thing is, I know how odd it is to just ask someone to sit with you without making conversation, even if you're at a coffee shop or another chill kind of place. To be honest, I don't have the energy to talk to others at the moment, but I'm definitely an extrovert and I've learned I need the company of others to feel just a bit better, even if it's just for a short time. I want to be invited along to places and to hang out with others - I just don't want to be a soggy bag of beans that people take places because they feel obligated to, especially since the majority of my ""people time"" is spent vacantly staring into space trying to bring myself back into my body from disassociation. A lot of the time, I know it looks like I'm in pain because I have a horrendous poker face, but I genuinely do enjoy being out with others, though I'm well aware it doesn't look like I do most of the time. 
Do you think it's too much to ask my friends to just sit with me, doing homework or drinking coffee/tea/beverage-of-choice? If it's not, how do I ask friends for help without turning them into therapists? I don't want someone to listen to my sadness rants, I just want some company.

Spent most of the times reading in childhood which led to a bigger gap between me and the other kids. My school and highschool time is a haze but I remember trying so hard to be normal until I managed to do something, anything to get anyone to laugh at me. Thinking back, I guess I wanted some attention since I didn't have any friends.
Thanks god, things did get better at university. But while I was for the first time happy, the downside is that I fell deeper in depression every now and then.
Self harm started to get worse until I needed stitches for deep cut who wouldn't stop bleeding for days.
Got a job, had the best period of my life but I still managed to fuck it up. Best grade, best friends, best period of my life. Also worse breakdowns and depressions. I can't manage a relationship since I have no clue of what to do, from kissing to fucking. Managed to leave my job to focus on uni but lost my friends on the way.

A little backstory, I am 17 and haven't regularily gone to school for 4 and a half years. I had to go to court for it every year until I turned 16, through that time I went to many different psychologists, was on probation for a year and finally started taking medication! For the past year I've been feeling much better and stopped considering self harm as an option. Fast forward to the present and I am sleeping in the basement living room of my grandparents house. No job, no school and only grade 10 education. I keep thinking about where to go from here and how much time I have wasted.
(I'm gonna stop worrying about proper grammer now cause its too tiring)
Recently I've been feeling a decline in my cognitive ability and memory and that really scares me. I keep trying to think of some kind of job I can do but most times I finally get the courage to apply I read Highschool Diploma or higher. Then I go back to wallowing in self pity and feeling sorry for myself. I hate how little I exercise I get but everytime I try to do it I miss a day or two and quit. I cant even enjoy gaming with my friends most days now and I feel like I have no redeeming qualities. I am unhappy with my weight and I feel like a dissapointment to my family who are super supportive of me considering how useless I am.
Anyway the point is I am 17, I can barely take care of myself and I am terrified of the future. Any advice?"

But being an empath and also having depression is like mental torture.

I’ve always been described as a caring and thoughtful and loving friend. I find joy in helping others.
Yet when I’m plummeting into that dark space I end up weeping in bed after hours of being locked away in my room isolating myself and not a soul has checked in on me. I start convincing myself I’m this unloved and unwanted thing. Why can’t they see how much I’m hurting? How different I’ve been acting? Why hasn’t anyone check in on me?

tl:dr- Because I am short and not attractive, I feel people don’t treat me the same as others unconsciously.
I’m a stereotypical nerd. Always does well in school and participates in clubs and all that. What makes me different is that i’m a high schooler is who is exactly 5 feet tall. I don’t know about the median height where you live but where i live i’m about the bottom 2% for my age. 
I always had a lot of people i could consider friends but it’s not the same as having authentic friends. All the friends I had in middle school became the popular group in high school, and I’m still friends with them today. See, i’ve known them for 4 years and I’ve only ever hung out with them once. I feel as if they don’t include me but i don’t know if that is true. 
Also, I just don’t look good. I’m not attractive in any way, even though i am short i’m somewhat fat as well. I’ve liked a few people through my high school years, but never have they liked me back. My repulsive face and body, my height, and that fact that no one has ever liked me before just chisels down my confidence.
My friends on the other hand just do so much better than me. They have all had girlfriends and they all have hung out with each other multiple times. I enjoy being with my friends in school and I believe they enjoy my presence too. I just feel like the only reason I can’t get a partner is due to my height and appearance. 
I don’t believe my friends do this intensionally, but i feel segregated every time i talk to them or i’m with them. I remember reading this scientific article about a persons appearance singlehandedly being able to control how many words a person wanted to communicate with them by 66%. Maybe this is what is happening to me. I’m being unconsciously segregated from everyone I talk to because I look repulsive.

6 months ago I decided to just stop resisting the panic and anxiety and just let is wash over me. I’m tired of fighting, there is no more energy left. For 10 years I’ve been trying to look at life from a bright perspective but I can’t do it anymore. 
Ever since that decision 6 months ago a feeling of depression crawling over me. For the past week these waves of depression and hopelessness came up so strong that I feel like I’m disassociating: I can only lie down and undergo the feeling, like I’m smothered by dread and terror.
For the past days or so I’ve been entertaining the thought of suicide. I don’t see a way out of this, and if this will be the quality of my life for the rest of my life I don’t feel like riding it out.

I was feeling overworked and stressed in my job and had feelings of pressure that I was not achieving high enough so I applied for a new job within the company and although I had internal doubts that I would be able to keep up with the workload and amount of responsibility, I managed to ace the interview and was successful. 
Only a month into the role I was not sleeping and contracted a severe double ear infection and was still going into work where I was unable to hear people asking me questions and was in constant pain. I was prescribed antibiotics, but they did not work so I was referred to a specialist who provided me with drops and I was signed off work. The drops cleared the infection but I was still having issues with my hearing, after seeing the specialist the second time I was told that both of my eardrums had chronic perforations and that unless I had surgery I would not be able to hear properly again and there was a 25% chance that even with surgery I would not regain the hearing I had lost. 
When I exited the hospital, I broke down in the street, I was sobbing into my sleeve as I walked, and I was at a total loss of what to do. I had been having negative thoughts for a long while, but I had been able to lift myself from them but now they seemed to be hitting me hard and I began to feel that life just was not worth living.
I went home and kept having suicidal thoughts, I kept thinking of ways to end my life without affecting my husband financially, ways in which my death would look accidental in nature. I was home alone for weeks thinking about ways to end my life and I was hiding it from my husband. I did not want to hurt him, for him to see me as a burden in his life or for him to think I was weak and a failure. I kept receiving emails about my situation from work and weeks turned to months and I began to dread having to go to the doctor to ask for a sicknote (which he was more than happy to provide). I lost all purpose and felt like there was nothing in life that I wanted to do. I would make comments about how the anaesthetic from the surgery for my ears might go wrong and then I would not have to think about any of this.
It all came to a head when I was due to return to work and I asked my husband if he could see himself continuing with the same job and he said yes and I looked him in the eyes and simply said I can’t do it anymore. Unfortunately, the timing of this was very poor as we were due to have guests around and he could see that I was in severe distress, but it was too late to cancel. I managed to hold back and after the guests left, we spent the whole night talking, much of which was me sobbing hard about how I did not want to continue to be alive. My whole body hurt; I had been trembling which meant my muscles were sore. My eyes were raw from the tears and from rubbing them. My throat hurt from the gasps of anguish and crying as I explained my issues.
My husband took me to see my GP the next morning and I found it difficult to start the conversation. My husband began and as he told the GP he burst into tears and it broke me again. I don’t think I have ever seen my husband cry. It hurt me to the core to see him so upset. The GP was shocked and immediately prescribed me with antidepressants and information for counselling and support.
Since then my mood has been up and down, I try to think about the future but its very hard to be positive or think of things I want to do or achieve. I hate being off work as it makes me feel like a burden, even though I was receiving sick pay and my company is supportive I just wanted to get it over with and continue with my life but the only issue I kept coming up against was doing what? I have no idea.
The feelings of being a burden kept growing stronger, especially as I knew the sick pay would be reduced to half and then I would be financially dependant on my husband which I feel to be unfair and has never happened in the 13 years we have been together. I have worked hard to try and find something I love enough to consider the possibility of doing as a career, but it is a real struggle. I also wanted to try coming off the medication in order to be less drowsy the following day so I could get more things done so I stopped taking it (for two weeks). I decided that as I love animals, I would try home boarding as an option and in order to relive myself of the pressure to return to my old job I handed in my resignation. My employer was very reluctant to accept the resignation but I honestly did not see me ever being able to return to that role and if I did I am sure that the feelings would build up again and I would end up in the same position. 
My first experience of home boarding was awful, within an hour of receiving the dog I felt pressured, stressed and anxious so much so that I ended up in tears and back on my medication, I was constantly berating myself. The owner stated the dog was house trained and friendly to other dogs (I have two dogs myself) but this was not true, and I was having to juggle a very energetic animal with my own pets. My husband kept offering to help but as he had been working all week, I kept telling him no, that this was my responsibility as he had already done his working week. But I couldn’t cope. The dog managed to run upstairs and peed on the spare bed which again caused me to get upset. The dog was uncontrollable, unresponsive to commands and not house trained; the idea to be a home boarder now felt horrible and I recalled handing in my notice and asking myself “what have I done?” The dog also had separation anxiety and I did not want this to affect both me and my husband so I slept in a separate bed with the dog in the room, shushing it every 30 minutes and hoping it did not rip up the carpet, skirting, door or anything else. Needless to say, I did not sleep well that night. 
The next day I asked my employer if it would be possible to rescind my  resignation and assign me to a part time position, on a lower grade with lesser responsibilities but as I have offered my resignation it is up to them if they accept this. I know my husband will support me to find a new job, so this is not an issue for me, but I still feel reckless for just leaving to try something new without having tried it first. I guess it is a lesson learnt.
In all this time I have been on group therapy sessions, received counselling and have used the support service ‘shout!’ and have been more open about my feelings with my husband when I am having a particularly bad day. I realised how much I love to write, and I am now considering looking at this as a possible career in the future. I am going to take one day at a time and explore the opportunities I have available to me and I will go back to work even if it is part time whilst I decide what I really want to do.
I can’t say that I am cured but I do feel that I have made some progress. Without talking to my husband as scary as it was or going to my GP to seek support, I don’t think I would be here today. I urge anyone who has felt like I have, to seek help. It is scary, but it is worth it; you are not alone in this and there is always someone to talk to."

The reason being is that my sister's husband had past away from cancer leaving her and my 2 year old niece alone in this world. I suffer from severe depression and I realized that I wanted to be around the family and help her out, spoil and take care of my niece etc. 
During my planning to move back, my father offered me a job working for his construction company building, flipping and repairing houses.
I was pretty reluctant as my father and I don't have good history. But I did figure it would help me get settled in. I also was looking for a place to rent and was talking to my mother about a few places around the town. My father then suggested that I move into one of the houses that they haven't started on yet and wouldn't be working on for a year. He wanted me to work on the house in my spare time while also watching after the place to make sure that no one broke into it since they were storing tools and materials in the house. 
After thinking about it I decided to take him up on his offer and so I moved across the country and into the house. Set up my bed and unpacked the basic essentials. I decided to keep the rest of my stuff in the boxes as I didn't want to get dust on anything and because I was planing to move into another place during the summer. 
So I worked for my father and after the first payday he lets me know that his credit card info was stolen and someone took over $90,000. He says he can pay everyone but one person till he gets his insurance for the card taken care of, which should be done next week. He asked if he could just add the money on to my next pay check and would put it in the bank account. I'm thinking that I'm not hurting for money since I saved up for the move and had money in the bank for a few months. So I said ""Yeah that's fine"". It's family right...
So next pay check rolls around and no money gets deposited into my account. My father is across country taking care of business for a few days, I can't get a hold of him. I had worked a lot of over time helping him. 
After he flew back I went over to my parents house in the morning for breakfast and to talk with him. My mother was sitting down as I was grabbing some pancakes and I mention to him that I haven't been paid yet. My mom looked dumb founded and said ""you haven't been paid?"". She looked at my father giving him a look. She figured I was being paid. He then said ""I can't afford to pay you at the moment"". I asked him ""what do you mean you can't pay me, you said you would be putting the money in my account"". My mom then replied, ""I think you should stop working for him till he pays you"". I then said alright and finished eating before going back to the house that I was staying at and started looking for another job. 
My father stopped by the house later that afternoon and talked with me. He told me that I need to find another place to stay, I figured he wasn't happy that I mentioned he hadn't paid me in front of my mother and that she had talked to him. So I found a place to stay that night and brought some boxes over. Since I wouldn't be able to use the haul trailer till the weekend was over I left my bed and other stuff at the house. 
Early the next morning I headed over to the house to grab some more boxes and I notice a truck in the yard. I went inside the house and their was a stranger sleeping in my bed, using some of my stuff. I recognized him and he recognized me as we met along time ago. He was a old friend of my dads that worked with him at the mine decades ago. He got up and started talking to me over some coffee. He mention that he came back in town yesterday for a funeral and ran into my father. My Father then offered him a place at the house yesterday morning. He didn't know it was my bed as my father didn't mention it to him. He also mention that my father gave my money to my brother cause my brother was going through bankruptcy and need some extra cash to support the 5 kids. 
So that's it. Turns out my father kicked me out to give my bed to a old friend of his. Gave $5500 that he owed me to my brother. I later talked to my mother and she said that none of their info for any of their credit cards were ever stolen so he lied to me too. 
So I'm out $5500. Had to find another place to work and stay."

I’m just this big cloud over their lives.
I’ve tried to go to therapists but I went through a series of increasingly bad ones with the last one saying the same thing- she was tired of hearing me say the same stuff and she couldn’t help me anymore. So it didn’t really help me.
And in the end it just makes me feel worse. I really, really wish I could just turn off my emotions forever. That way I wouldn’t feel anything and no one would be bothered by me.

Well something that really helped me is crafting my vision first. I spent about 200 hours researching and figuring out what it was I wanted to do. Instead of just going out to flip burgers etc (just for the sake of staying busy). 
TAKE FREAKING TIME TO ASK YOURSELF HOW YOU WANT YOUR FUTURE TO BE.
So many people just go from retail job to retail job, not stopping and asking: what the hell is my future?
I even quit after my first day at a sweat shop factory because I didn't have a vision there. I was on break with a guy who looked like shit and asked him, ""how long have you been here?"" He said ten years.
I DID NOT WANT TO BE HIM AT 35. He was my anti-model.
Now I have crafted a vison. Thanks to Graham Stephan, Gabe Bult, and others.The vison is to be retired by 35 with part time math teaching.
Based on that I made steps. 
Steps:
Work at Local company, switch to higher paying job, save, invest in property, cycle properties, retire by 35, teach math and enjoy life and family.
Now that I have a vision, I will do whatever it takes because of I have already set my focus on the horizon. Everything in the middle are just steps along my personally crafted path.
But this is important: Find people who actually took paths similar to your vision. On youtube, on podcasts, and in real life. Make sure they were nirm people like you and made it work.
Model their paths. And go kick ass in life."

I wished someone would thank me for being alive, I wished someone would catch me when I was falling, I wish someone would tell me it was going to be okay.
My life’s become so sad, today I failed again a number on a paper that sticks in my head defining me. Today I realized I had never been happy… with myself I never laughed with myself never told myself I was the reason I was going to wake up happy being me. I was happy because I could see others happy, I was happy because I could make them smile and laugh. In the world we live in the ones who make others laugh are assumed to be the happiest which couldn’t be further from the truth, as I write this, I think about what has made me live for so long. And I concluded that it was seeing others have something that I could only share.
It’s sad to me. I never thought I was smart, I never wanted to be classified, but you gather people with common interests, and those are the people around me ‘smart’ ones at that. I never realised but admitting to them I wasn’t like them would be the hardest, I didn’t want to live a life of lies, telling myself I was like them, but I didn’t want them to leave; feeling they wouldn’t accept me, at least I felt like they wouldn’t .
Home isn’t easy either but it is what it is, I always knew we weren’t rich but I was grateful, I didn’t ask for much didn’t get much too eat and that’s how I lived, but dad would always compare to ‘the geniuses’ the kids who graduated uni at like 13 or whatnot with what he believed was ‘no assistance’ he talked ill of tutoring which is popular in my area. Not having the extra guidance others had always placed me behind them. Embarrassed he asked If I wanted to go tutoring as he realized most of his friends sent their children, but I could see his intentions were to force my mouth and say I didn’t, as he was always belittling those whoever asked for help in life or weren’t just naturally gifted which is what he thought to be the cause of intellect. I knew that if I performed poorly even with him spending the already low amount of money we had I would become the disappointment of the family, with a lack of esteem and confidence I didn’t take up his offer fearing the shame to come.

As for stuff that's happened, well:
1) I \*almost\* had a date. I'm 21 years old, I have never been on a date on my life since I was homeschooled and very socially awkward. I've been using dating apps for two years with no luck until I matched with this girl a few weeks ago. We talked and chatted over the phone and things were looking well, we even had a date scheduled. But the day before, she messages me saying that she's not ready for a relationship.  I told her I understood, I didn't want to be a dick about it. But deep down...I felt pretty hurt. I was almost there, and the rug was pulled under from me. It felt like God's cruel joke. I'm not mad at the girl or anything because she's not obligated to date me (although I do wonder why she was on a dating app in the first place...?); but I will say it hurt a bit. We haven't spoken since.
2) My job. It fucking sucks. I'm a pizza delivery driver and I hate it. Customers are rude and the managers keep pressuring me to do everything faster. I'm autistic and I'm really not meant for this kind of work environment, but my parents charge me rent so I really need a job. They keep making me answer the phones even though they know how much social anxiety it gives me. I showed up late to work the other day and got a warning that next time I'll be written up and honestly...I don't care anymore. But I've realized I might be doing shitty jobs like this for the rest of my life, all this meaningless toil just so I can survive. It's so pointless. So fucking empty.
3) I had to cancel a film shoot for a movie I've been making. This is the third time I've had to cancel it and I've been working on this one scene for MONTHS. Why? Because of the fucking coronavirus. Everything fun is getting shut down. Except work. Of course I have to go to work. Filmmaking is one of the few things that I'm passionate about, that makes me feel alive. And of course that has to get shit on too.  
I feel like I'm about to explode any minute. There's just so much pent up grief and frustration and anxiety and depression inside of me. I don't know what to do.

hobbies are good for nothing more than killing time. as a teenager I loved creative writing but now when I do it it's more out of habit than any love, passion, or enjoyment.

I don't really understand people who look forward to things - I used to! but, well...

I genuinely believe life is no more meaningful than just killing time and busying yourself until you get to die.

I do laugh and have love a lot. I genuinely don't believe I'm depressed. I function well, wake up consistently, study hard and get good grades. not much of a choice on that front, but I know depression is crippling when it comes to things like that.

I guess I'm just looking for advice on how to find enjoyment or passion in... well, anything?

I consider my view on life a little nihilistic even though I'm regularly and known to be goofy, loud, and outspoken.

even the shows and books and stuff that I think I love don't really trigger much emotion in me. happy or sad. I feel like any reaction I have to my friends (like: ""GOD IM SO SAD ABOUT [chapter]"") is 100% habit.

My friends ik wont care if anything happened to me they’d  move on after a day or two. I’m positive that if I leave this earth no one will give a shit after my funeral. Just another number to add to the list.
I hate living I hate everything about myself I have nothing to keep me going really at all I just wanna die. There’s just one problem tho and it’s that I can’t do it. I don’t have access to any guns, and everything else is too painful and I’d never have the guts to do it any other way. All I’d have to do with a gun is just pull the trigger which I’m sure wouldn’t be easy either but at least it’s quick and I could end my suffering.
I pray everyday for things to start turning around and I work hard in school and sports but nothing ever seems to work I want to die. I want to die and I want it so fucking bad."

About two years ago I was diagnosed with narcolepsy. This diagnosis caused me to be separated from the military. At the time I was ok with it. I felt that it was just a sign to move on to another stage of my life. From there I decided to go back to school. I wanted to finish my degree and get a job using that degree. This would have went well but unforeseen circumstances have caused some major issues with that plan. The school isn’t offering the classes that I need to finish the degree for at least a term for one and two for the other courses. With school being payed by the VA and them also providing a housing allowance this was my source of income, but I can’t get that in on if I’m not going to school. I was fully prepared to cut down on spending while I waited to find a job to tide me over. I am married and my wife has a steady job so at least we have some income, but I have been the only one to cut down on the spending. While trying to get my wife to cut down a little bit on spending, she decided to get an additional job to earn a little extra money. Initially I was very happy with that. The thing is she has been always working and I am struggling to get a job. The bills were fine initially but eventually credit card began having higher and higher balances and the savings began dwindling. My wife has been using her second job not to assist in paying the bills but to sequester away to use as fun money. Again no issue initially. Over time it was notice that more an more time and money was spent towards time with her friends while I ended up stuck at home based on the fact that money was leaving faster than it was coming in. I have asked to be included, but she tells me she doesn’t want my negativity around her friends. This hurt me and made me take a close look at the situation. The past year or so communication has really been almost nonexistent between us about the happenings of our lives. This was ok when I was In The military because I spent a large portion of my time at work. I really wanted to push towards better communication and time together when we could get it without cutting out her friends.  I began working my communication while I was busy with school. I made sure to tell her when I had free time so that we could spend time together. Multiple times that I let her know that I was going to be free on a specific day or that I would make time to spend with her when I knew she was free, she would instead make plans with her friends. Time after time of this happening has just beat me down emotionally. It’s even more noticeable now that I am home all the time job hunting and I still get to see my wife less then her friends see her. The combination of the situations that put me in an idle state and it seeming like she doesn’t want to be around me has put me in a very dark place. I have been seeing a counselor with her over the past couple of months in hopes of rebuilding the communication bridge and trying to get her to see how I feel and me to see how she feels about everything. The thing is that whenever a conversation about such things happens between us she glazes over and it seems like no attention is being payed. This again bashed my self worth. The counselor eventually referred me to a medical professional who diagnosed me with major depression and prescribed me medication. The medication helps for the most part, but I keep getting lack of value impressions from my wife that just puts me right back in my hole. Over the past few months I have thought about suicide many many times. I have never thought about doing it, just about how I could do it. This scares the crap out of me. It takes a lot of thinking about my parents and my sister to get those negative thoughts out of my head. I am at a loss though I love my wife so much, and I think my wife loves me in her own way. The thing is us not being on the same page is destroying me, and in turn our relationship. I know it’s not all my fault and that it’s not all hers, it is a combination of everything. I feel like I have been bending over backwards to promote healing in my life and my relationship with my wife. I don’t feel that I am getting the effort back from my wife. I am at a loss of what to do. I can’t seem to dig myself out of this hole and I can’t seem to get the help from my wife because neither of us know how. My wife not knowing how to help seems to have turned into not wanting to deal with it. 
My life is not where I want it to be right now, and I feel like I am lacking the support to get there by the one I love most."

« No, you stay in your room and interiorize yourself. I don’t have to go through it with you ».
I know, it’s not necessarily better for me to do that, but I don’t want to hurt anyone else when I am like this.

It brings me to tears, to hear those words.

That's one thing is that they had to take care of me which I feel bad about cause I genuinely ruined their night, but on top of that after one person sent me the videos I just saw myself saying stuff that was super out of hand in that I was just unloading all of my emotions and talking about how I hated life etc. So now I feel like shit cause I feel like I was such an asshole by drinking that much and making it so unpleasant for everyone else. But now I'm thinking more about what happened and after talking to my mates some more I think the best way forward is to get some help, yet I know that when I ask my mum she will say no.

To see the out pouring of people sharing their stories is amazing. I've recently started on medication (Prozac 20mg) and let me tell you WHAT A GAME CHANGER. My thoughts are far more clear and the so much negativity is gone. My ability to think rationally now is so unreal it's almost euphoric. It's been about a month now and I've gone through so many changes with my mental health it is truly exciting and such a relief. However, as the days go by and the euphoria of this clarity dwindles I find myself becoming stressed over the flood of thoughts and positivity. I was wondering if there was anyone else out there that can offer some of their experiences or advice to keep powering forward and conquering this what I see as a second chance with mental health. 
 To give you some background on myself; I am know 30 and was diagnosed with depression at a very young age (6-7). Until recently I wasn't aware of that fact which was honestly a bit disturbing to hear. Also, on top of that, as it turns out, I was medicated shortly after being diagnosed and for some reason given the choice a few months later to stop the medication (idk what med). Naturally as a 7 or 8y.o I chose not to take it anymore. For as long as I can remember I was always that kid that had some sort of erratic behavior. Anything I did it was to the max. Every feeling and emotion was amplified and caused me to act out in a less than constructive manner. I had and lost countless friends because of my behavior and never really knew why. As I got older the confusion and heart ache of not understanding why I was the way I was turned a lot of the embarrassment into fear and anger. Once middle school came around I started to act out and get in a lot of trouble. By 7th grade I had been arrested for the first time and severed every friendship I had but one. I then went to a private school for HS where things started to get better and I was able to reinvent myself. I was in a tougher area with tougher people who could handle me and put me in my place when things got bad. The trouble continued. I was arrested again sophomore year and the outbursts only got worse from there. I now realize that I was a person who self harmed. I tried on several occasions to hang myself in elementary school, I would make dangerous and impossible jumps to send me and my bike off knowing I wouldn't lad safely in middle school, I ran/skated head first as hard as I could into people on the ice and on the football field sometimes knocking myself out because I like the way i punished myself, I enlisted as a grunt in the Marines to go to combat and hopefully be killed so I didn't have to do it myself, I failed in college, I failed in a construction setting, I became a firefighter for many of the same reasons as the Marines, I torture myself with horrific online videos, and worst of all I was self depricating to the point of immobility and almost suicide several times. Last year I decided to seek help because I was in a relationship with a person I thought was the one. Best decision I ever made. After refusing so many times out of skepticism I finally decided to take medication. It took two different meds to find the right one but wow what a change. I can happily say I've made significant improvement in my mental health and finally feel I can be happy. I'm out of a toxic relationship and into a brand new world. Does anyone share similar stories or want to hear more about mine to see if you relate? Open to any and all questions."

    First of all, I'm a 19 year old gay guy om my last semester in college before transfering to a new college. I've been single my whole life and honestly at this point the feeling of loneliness is eating me up. I can't watch gay couples be happy anymore because it makes me feel so bitter and jealous that I dont have what they have and they I'm going to lose out on the teenage gay dates that I dreamed about in high school. Recently, I managed to ask out a guy I was interested in recently (he said i wasnt his type) and I thought this would be a huge step towards progress but now I feel like there's no one left. 
     To be clear, I'm glad I asked him out. I feel now like I can move on and not stay stuck on him like I have with other guys. But college is so much less social than high school was for me and I feel like there isnt anyone out there for me to date. At least no one I'd be able to date in the few months I have before transfering.
      My loneliness has become worse recently because I stopped talking to my best friend. We got in a fight after I told her I asked someone out and how much my loneliness has been hurting me. I felt like I had to stop talking to her because it hurt having a conversation with someone about feeling how deeply painful this loneliness I'm feeling is when they're in a 2 year long relationship and living with their boyfriend and raising a dog. How do you tell someone that the reason it hurts to be unloved by anyone is because you cant even comprehend being loved in the first place?
      I dont know how to explain this loneliness, all I know is how bitter I've become. I dont even want to talk to other guys because I dont want to get my hopes up and get hurt. I honestly hate how bitter I'm becoming, and even worse is I hate how little I'm doing to stop it. Even when I spend time with friends it can be fun and fulfilling but when I'm home alone it all feels empty. I have a friend who just broke up with his girlfriend and now suddenly wants to hang out a ton, and I'm flattered but I keep getting these thoughts of ""I've been lonely like this for so long and you did nothing, why should I help you?"" It hurts me to think that and it hurts me to see how often I do it. 
   Before, I thought having sex would help my loneliness but then I lost my virginity to a guy on a dating app and I felt terrible about it. Several hookups with other guys later, I've realized that I probably just wanted to feel attractive. All the guys I've been with have been significantly older than me and I have started feeling like the older guys just want to exploit my youth and the guys my age are too good for me and that I'm not attractive enough for them 
       A year ago i used to weigh around 230 pounds (I'm 5'9 so pretty overweight, especially for a gay guy) and my mom would make comments about it. Last semester, I started adderall for my ADHD and one of the side effects is that it suppresses my appetite, so for the last year I've been using it to starve myself and skip meals so that I can lose weight and be more attractive. In the about 6 months since I started I've gotten down to 185 pounds, but even despite that, I dont feel attractive. I feel as though all I can see are the guys that reject me on Grindr and then i ignore the attraction from all the guys thatI dont find attractive. Hell, even the ones that I do find attractive dont make me feel better; I just feel like I managed to trick them into believing that I'm attractive. 
       I've been scraping by each day for the past month and a half and it's clear that this loneliness, now including a lack of a best friend, is affecting my life. I failed an exam for the first time ever (I'm a 4.0 gpa student with 1 B in my college career) and I feel like my life is drifting away from everything. I'm hoping that when I transfer I can become someone I more enjoy and start fresh. I wanna get a couple tattoos and a couple piercings, cut my hair and embrace a new side of me, but I'm scared that I'll just feel more alone. Honestly, I dont know if I can handle being more alone. I'm not even sure how I've survived this long, and I've noticed that I dont even let myself think of long term plans because I'm not sure if I'll make it to then.
       I've seen the effects of suicide (a close friend of mine passed away from it when I was in high school) and I wouldnt want to hurt anyone like that, especially not my mom (she told me directly how much a loss like that would hurt her and my siblings) but honestly I feel like I'm failing in life. Ive had tons more suicidal thoughts than I usually have, and i catch myself feeling like I wanna give up while I'm behind
      I'm still trying to push on. I'm hoping that something will change for the better and that maybe it'll he one huge thing tommorow, or next week, or maybe it'll be a bunch of little things. Either way its something better, and  I'm doing my best to hold out to see those things come true. I'm just scared at how hard it's been getting to keep moving forward and I'm not sure how I'm going to keep managing. If I fail my classes I wont transfer and I already have plans to move in June. 
      Im sorry for the long post, I needed to get that out of my system. I'll appreciate any insight or comments, but just being able to say this , even to anonymous strangers that might never see this, is helping."

Not my first, but maybe the worst since my first in 1989 when I made my first (pathetically failed) suicide attempt. For most of the next 4 years I hid it - apparently successfully - until a dissociation crisis in Dec 2018 scared me enough to take another chance on the local mental health system despite the significant risk their antiquated attitudes to mental illness would cost me my job and maybe my family.

A few months later, I finally told my wife, who is local, and was treated to a lecture about how I'm weak, how everyone has problems, how I was stupid to let the doctors ""trick"" me into taking pills when all I needed was good friends and a hobby. I brushed it off, and worked it anyway. This time last year I was in full remission and came off the meds. And I was doimg great, feeling more like *me* than I had in decades. 

But the weeks became months, and the months added up, and by the time summer came I was painfully aware of how disconnected we were. Some of that is definitely due to my depression - the sour moods, the pulling away - but more was because she had just refocused in ways that excluded me from her life. And when I look back, I realised that half my problem had been that when things were worst I no longer felt safe reaching out to her. In August I started slipping again, in October I needed to gp back on meds, by the end of November my doctprs gave me anti-psychotics - just in case the urge to self-harm or suicide got too much to manage.

An now it's a New Year. I had a long break over Christmas so I wanted to visit family and friends back home. She and the kids didn't come. And it's been so good. The enthusiasm and love from friends and family is incredible. I haven't felt so loved and wanted in so long. That's a problem. 

Today I realised that depression has killed my marriage. I don't know how we can get back from here, but I know the sense of isolation and the lack of partnership is a big part of why I relapsed. Getting bavk might literally be impossible. And now I'm stuck with an impossible decision on top of already having days when I really, really wish it would all just end."

bad hygiene. i make sure that i don’t smell bad while at school and keep my hair clean, but that’s about it

no care for anything anymore. i used to be the most empathetic and caring person, but i feel desensitized to most things and never worry or care about anything
can’t laugh easily anymore. i used to laugh all the time, at everything. i guess that as you get older that happens, but i literally don’t find anything funny that other people do and i can’t remember the last time i laughed really hard

I have no close friends, and my family doesn't really give me moral support. I lost my dad 4yrs ago, and the weight of everything he left was thrown at me. Which started making my depression worse. Before that I was getting better, slowly but better, then that happened and everything just crashed on me. His words still haunt me ""What are you going to do when I die? You're just probably going to lose everything."" He emotionally abused my mother and I for a long time. I feel it's PTSD but I wasn't officially diagnosed so I can't say. I have no insurance to go to a therapist. I tried a couple antidepressants one made me feel worse and the other made my eyes so dry, they hurt, so I haven't tried again.

I can’t have anything good for myself, because I fuck everything up. I try to be positive, but I always feel my depression over my shoulder and just shitting on everything I want to believe in. 
People always say “you’re beautiful, you make friends so easy,” but I feel like the ugliest and fattest person I know. I never come first to anyone, and nobody ever really understands just how painful it is to live with depression. It’s not the same for everyone. For me, it’s literally like “I want to go to Japan,” and then immediately after I remember my lack of stable income and my mountain of student debt (also, no degree, a three time drop out because I was always breaking down.) Sometimes it’s “I want to maybe fall in love,” and then I hear this voice, distorted but my own, calling me an idiot and saying that no one will ever want me, you’re disgusting and unstable, you need to lose 20 pounds and maybe you’ll be decent. 
Do people really not understand the idea of your depression being you vs. every single one of insecurities on the most poisonous and obnoxious levels at all times? So much so that it becomes impossible to shut it out?
I can’t handle being alone either. I stare at my phone and realize I only have two people who are there for me, which is more than most. But I can’t help but feel like I’m a burden, always.

I’ve put off getting help since I was 15. Now I’m 22, and I feel like all my emotional problems follow me to the mirror.

I got up early and took and shower and got ready nicely for once and thought that today would be an actually good day. My mom and I went to eat lunch at a nice deli and got home at about 1:30. She told me that in a bit we'd go to the mall and she'd let me pick out some stuff that I wanted and that we'd go out to eat and that I'd be able to invite some friends over. I ended up watching TikTok for a long time and suddenly it was 7:30. I go out to look for my mom and she's asleep in the car and won't listen to anything I say.

I'm going to school full time and have a pretty solid gpa. My plan is to become a highschool teacher and I'm making decent progress towards it. This is about the only thing that I can tell myself for reassurance when I really start to feel down though. Still, it will take me 4 years (1 1/2 more) of community college to get the associates and the 90 units I need for subbing and an additional 3 years to become a teacher, and I feel like that makes me seem weak. Especially since you're supposed to get that associates degree in 2 years. 

Now to explain the insecurities I have, I guess ill start with my weight. I think being a fat kid really messes with your development. Not just because kids constantly tease you but it literally caused my hormones to go out of whack and give me high estrogen in highschool. I lost 100 pounds before my senior year and I'm still chubby 3 years down the road. 
I just cant stick to a exercise and diet regimen for very long. I'm about 30 pounds overweight with probably 20 of those pounds being fat. I do go running up hills and/or do bodyweight circuits and burn around 600 additional calories a day. Still I offset this by eating 2800 calories or more every day. With all that's going on in my life I wish I could just accept my current weight and say I'm healthy, but I'm not that attractive because of it. I have a lot of weight on my stomach and I have a bit of female breast tissue that makes me look feminine with my shirt off. My body makes me cringe when I look at it and I constantly am thinking about how gross I probably look. With all the other shit going on in my life I just cant set aside more than the 2 hours a day I already put into my body and the food addiction has actually improved from when I was a kid and would eat 4000 calories a day. I'm hungry 24/7 and it hurts when people tell me I just need to stop being lazy and get into shape upon bringing this up. 

As far as my face goes, I'm like an average 7/10 or so. I can't really complain about it even though I could look a lot nicer. I am told I look like a 16 year old a lot.

Another huge insecurity of mine is having a small penis. It's right under 5 inches with girth on the low end of average and I worry it will severely limit the girls that will be willing to have a relationship with me. I know everyone is different, I just hope that the girls I'm attracted to dont end up being the type to care so much. 

The combination of extra weight, female breast tissue, a bit of a baby face, and being 6'0 tall make me feel like an awkward teenager still and my body just wont grow out of it. 

As far as hobbies go I play guitar regularly and I do slowly achieve goals I set for it. Still, I dont have the time to put into it to become a professional level musician even though my theory knowledge is close to it. I used to be really good at piano but I stopped playing when my mom died. Music in general is the only reason I'm still alive as corny as that sounds. It's my favorite part of the human experience and one of the closest things we have to magic. Although guitar can do a good job distracting me, I dont feel fulfilled when practicing in my room. 

In highschool I was a heavy drug user for about 10 months of my life. I can't say for sure, but I theorize that I did a lot of damage to my mental development by taking xanax, opiates, and muscle relaxers damn near every day and often at the same time, washing them down with alcohol or codeine cough syrup. I was so depressed back then and my parents being old fashioned, didn't believe in depression. I self medicated and self-destructed for a while until something interesting happened. I asked the girl of my dreams out and she rejected me. My initial urge was to commit suicide but somehow rationality stepped in and I just threw away the drugs and set out to improve myself. I lost 70 pounds in 4 months and came back to my senior year completely different and clean except for marijuana. I think I wanted to prove her wrong about me because in my mind I was pretty sure she just thought i was a loser. 

Eventually i ended up experimenting with psychedelics which sadly gave me PTSD for about a year. I was believing in spiritual forces and extra sensory perceptive abilities because I was having flashbacks from the massive doses of LSD I had done. It took me a long time to figure out that it was my amygdala giving me flashbacks and that i wasnt seeing into some higher dimension and it really fucked me up to be borderline psychotic for all that time. 

At this point I've never been even slightly romantically involved with a girl even though many have been interested in me. I have strong requirements that any girl I date be a potential candidate for marriage even if she isnt necessarily the girl I end up marrying. Why would I date someone who I know my relationship wont work out with? One girl initially seemed great, but as we talked more, I realized her values were different from mine and that's the closest I've been to being in a relationship. Most girls, it only takes a few weeks of knowing them to rule them out. I find my situation to be additionally complicated by the fact that I like conservative minded women, but I'm not christian and not exactly conservative. I have bounced back and forth on the political spectrum until deciding the best result would be of compromise and unity, meeting in the middle. A decrease of radical ideas rather than a swing in either direction seems to be a philosophy that can be applied at multiple levels of life. 
A lot of college girls are crazy liberal and having tons of sex with different guys, not planning for the future, going to festivals etc... I wouldn't set myself up for failure with these types who are the opposite of the christian girls. 

I want to meet someone who is a good compliment to me, that would build me up and be a positive force in my life , but who also isnt trapped by dogma and institutional fears. I think I'm a very exceptional person. Which doesn't mean I'm great but that I fall under many exceptions both very good and very bad. This seems to make it harder to find people who i really connect with on a deep level even though superficially connecting with people is something I'm quite adept at, especially for an introvert. 

I write all of this out of loneliness and fear. I want to have someone to show affection to and to recieve affection from, and I'm worried that my inadequacies and my past and my odd perspective will ultimately lead me to becoming a failure who no one good wants to be around.

 I know I might be building a slippery slope here but this feeling gnaws at me constantly. Along with occasional paranoia and panic, and sometimes I just go completely numb. You see, I have really bad depression but I try not to let it define me and I dont like thinking that every word that comes out of my mouth is the result of a mental illness. So I've laid on the table so much of what bothers me on a daily basis and then decided to reveal that yes, I am depressed and I am also a human being who wants to feel like they are more than a diagnosis."

I ruined a lot of the friendships- if you would even call it that. I always put myself below them and that's the only thing that kept them around. I took people's advice and stood up for myself. I said what I thought and how they made me feel and I politely asked them to stop. I told them that I didn't want to be hurt anymore. What a mistake.
They didn't like that. That made them angry and leave. Everyone leaves in the end. They blame it on me or say how I'm better off with better friends. Some would tell me it was just a joke and to toughen up, but what's funny about telling someone they ""probably will commit suicide one day"" while laughing?
Maybe it's my fault.
Most hurt me but I didn't mind. It was tedious, name calling and a deadly mixture of words. I didn't mind. I didn't want to mind. But sometimes I wish some of them wouldn't have hurt me so badly. Hit me, tore me to shreds, dragged me by my hair, and become the monster that I feared hid under my bed and behind my bedroom door when I was a kid.  
I don't even know why I care. Everyone leaves in the end so there's no point. It's just a waiting game now. I probably did this to myself, but I wish I knew how I did so I can stop doing it.

Hotlines are honestly so shitty. This is from my experience so if you’re struggling please call them it’s not my place to say whether or not you should get help from a certain place. 
When I came out as Bi to my mom she made everything awkward.  She told people in my family I didn’t want knowing. I told her I was straight a couple weeks after. In that time period she asked why I suddenly liked boys and girls. The real reason was because I stumbled upon gay porn. I never told her. I just said, “i dunno, i just did.” She always was like “well what do you mean?” So yeah. But I’m still bi tho. 
I have randomly laid in bed and cried. I have written a lot of these rant vent things and it doesn’t help. Mostly because I over exaggerate and lie.  Its such a bad habit. I lie and dramatize things for attention and I fucking hate it. I hate myself and want to die. The world is better of without me. 
My friends are the “weird kids” at school while I’m still trying to be friends with them and stay with my other clique of friends that are somewhat normal. My best friend since second grade is like my personal therapist so I’ll be sending this to her probably. (Hi halle!) 
I should also add i am very jealous and rude and attention grabbing for no good fucking reason. It’s a bad habit that I’ve been needing to get rid of. I’ve been desperate for a relationship and I’ve been friend-zoned each and every single time. 
I shouldn’t be here. There was a mistake up there. 
I’m in such a bad mindset and I’m afraid if I even speak a lick of this to my mom she’ll take me to a actual therapist and then it’ll all get worse from there. 
I don’t care about my appearance and I honestly should. Or my hygiene. It’s bad. 
I’ve been thinking about what I should leave behind. A note? A recording? This? 
I love my friends and family but they’ll forget when I’m gone. They’ll all move on. 
I’m in a badplace. It hasn’t left or changed. I pretend to smile. 
I don’t know what to do. How to cope. I’m probably going to cut again tonight.

Even when I was 6/7, I remember feeling the exact same feeling as when I'm deeply depressed. The sort of heaviness and pit in your stomach. Most of my family is estranged and I truly just have my dad. I know that if it weren't for him still being alive, I would have done it.
I truly don't think I've ever been not depressed. Today, I just had the realization that it's been 10 years of 'official' depression, aka when they diagnosed me. It hasn't been better. It's been worst,  and they pain of knowing it's been so long makes it far far worse.
So my question is: how can I get out of depression, when I don't even know what 'normal' feels like? Is that even possible.

It's getting much worse, a lot of anxiety, sleeping, always stressed, feel like i am going insane, fake personality - haven't used my real personality in like 4 years, no friends, the last time i hung out with someone who's not a friend, i just wanted to hang out, was like 4 years ago. The first and last time i had a friend was 7/8 years ago, will 100% fail at school (i don't think i care about my school degrees but i just don't want to make my mother sad). 
I never realized how depression is actually ruining my life, i always ignore it but it's time to admit that it's making me go crazy. I just can't help it anymore..
I don't try to tell my mother because she doesn't take it seriously. Yes she's quite supportive.. sometimes. But in my country 80% of people are not well educated about mental disorders.
I always try to sound funny, happy and fake my personality so people wont think i suck. What's making my depression worse is social anxiety. But it's just time to admit it, after all these years of resisting against depression and fighting it, ignoring it, faking happiness. Depression wins. It got me. I can't do it. I can't do it anymore. I just want to get out of this world like right now. Just disappear.
I am always insecure, it came to a point where i just don't care anymore, don't feel anything. I always wear the same favorite clothes, a hoodie, cap to avoid people looking and hide my appearance. I can't do it. And i don't want to commit suicide, i've always stood against depression and not commit suicide but as i said, it's currently destroying me. I still am not sure about suicide, i don't think it's a solution.
Because i only live once, i am trying to enjoy life but a lot of things are preventing that, religious parents, extremely-sarcastic brother, social anxiety and no friends, depression, insecurities. I've always tried different hobbies that i like, and i still am doing these hobbies. It's still difficult since depression is just getting worse.

I don’t feel like I’m ever really going to amount to anything. I have many things I want to do, but I have absolutely zero patience for any of it. Books, tv, playing instruments, drawing, painting, learning new things, relationships... I just don’t have it in me to take the time to develop things. I’ll carry books around with me that I want to read, but my brain just goes, if we can’t pretty much absorb all the wisdom from this book through osmosis, then fuck it. I’ll read a little bit. Maybe get to page 80. But it’s difficult and 9/10 times I get bored and stop reading it. I feel no connection to tv at all, it’s just staring at a screen watching the screen flash and people interacting and talking. But I have no idea what’s going on and I couldn’t care less to know. They might as well be speaking a different language. Even when I get the rare desire to draw, in the end it doesn’t really feel rewarding. More like, that looks cool. Glad that’s finally done. I don’t want to take the time to learn the basics of anything, I want to learn Beethoven before the nursery rhymes. I wanted to teach myself Calculus before I made it to Algebra 2. I get frustrated with uncertainty that is involved in relationships and end up cutting people off. I know it takes time to develop a friendship, but in my mind I’m already on level 10 before we’ve even gotten to know each other, and you’re in all likelihood not. Then I feel like I’m swimming in an ocean rather than a pool, with no shore in sight, it feels pointless and I just want to throw it all away. Idk. Everything bores me. I just want to hit fast-forward on everything. Nothing really feels rewarding. 
So I just kinda sit here like a zombie on my phone, rereading old texts, looking at old pictures, looking at memes, mindless stuff. Getting nothing done. It feels like my head empties out more and more. I don’t see how this is ever gonna change. It’s like I’m in a vacuum."

I'm 22 and I've suffered from mild depression and anxiety before in high school I am also introverted, but anyways, I have never dated before and have only asked three girls out because it takes a while for me to build up relationships as an introvert and its tough finding people that I open up to and am attracted too. 
 The first two times I was rejected I didn't really think anything of it.  This last rejection (It happened yesterday) has hit me differently for some reason and I don't understand why.  I've just felt alone all day, and more nervous and anxious and a little sick.  I don't understand it. She didn't reject me because she didn't like me. She even said that I was one of the few people she felt understood her at the college we go too.  She said no because she already had a boyfriend and that she still wanted to stay friends. (One of the main reasons I didn't want to ask her out was because I was worried we wouldn't be friends anymore) but that isn't an issue because she was worried that I wouldn't want to be friends, so I should feel fine, right? Move on like I did the others. 
But I just can't for some reason. Focusing on stuff is super difficult and I worry that I won't find anyone else to like, partially because its so hard for me to build meaningful relationships.
What should I do? How do I go about feeling better?  I want to move on and just be friends with her but I just don't get why I feel like I do.  I'm not obsessing over her I'm just really upset and depressed for something small and its really frustrating."

I have matured and my beliefs have changed but depression is emotional and so it is hard to rationalize with. I used to be sad that i havent had sex and im 19 now. But honestly its not a big deal, at least not to me and if someone else decides otherwise, fuck them its my life. My depression isnt really based on thought processes as much anymore its just a deep feeling of loneliness. 
It drove me to a massive drug binge with lots of acid every week for about a year and a half, then a short but intense benzo binge. Acid probably taught me a lot that i take for granted, but i know it taught me one thing, i cant answer these questions with anything that quick. It will always be a slow, painful and confusing process with some beautiful moments.
The benzos stop me from feeling for months. I dont remember a lot of it. During my first semester of college i was almost entirely unconscious. I was effectively the living dead. And then i almost died for good. My friend told me my heart had stopped briefly. But came back as the drugs wore off in time for me to survive.
Since then i cant explain it but ive changed drastically, in some good ways in some bad. I feel as though i did die and this is the new life i am living. And i often have a sensation that a part of me is still in the ""other world"", again hard to explain. But to be frank i saw nothing, just a peaceful unconsciousness. But if theres one thing ive learned, its that no tiny brained human such as me could ever truly understand the nature of life and death, so im gonna stop right their and let mystery be mystery.
The depression is coming back even though i am different now. Its become blatantly obvious to me that these things ive felt for so long cant be solved with things on the outside. Not even the embrace of a lover. I have spent so much time chasing a dream because reality was never enough. 
In the end i cant hide from myself or my nature, for it is what shapes my existence. And as far as i can tell death is the ultimate darkness. For that reason i no longer believe death is better than life. And ive realized its better to experience pain than nothing. You dont get what you want. And you dont know what you need until you've found it. I hope i find that one day."

It also doesn’t help how my family members don’t seem to care because he was “just a parakeet and not something like a dog.” This is the worst I’ve ever felt mentally. I miss him so much and my house and heart feel empty"

All those words, promises, from others are just lies. They'll forget their own words and will just hurt you again and again. I know everyone is tired. I know everyone is stressed. How is it that I can't feel tired when everyone can?
I didn't ask for this kind of mental state. I didn't want to be in this mental state. I guess it's easier to lie saying ""I'm fine,"" or making myself look ""happy."" It's easier to fake your happiness than to be truthful of what pains you.
I've probably vented too much on this subreddit and I think I should just keep myself quiet from now on. It's difficult and probably impossible but I really do hope everyone of you will have a good day, one day."

I was I side the house as I watched my roof being ripped off and felt the lift from the tornado, but oddly, I wasn’t afraid. I thought to myself, this is the end, I truly accepted and even embraced death. I kept telling my mom I loved her. But miraculously my family and I survived. 
Here is the kicker, since the tornado happened I have been eating more, feeling motivated, all that... it makes no sense... I had legitimately accepted death and 100% thought I was going to die, but the past 10 days I have only felt a small part of my previously, in my opinion, heavy depression.

A life that sucks this much isn't a life that I find worth living, but I don't want to destroy my chances to help other people, no matter how much it sucks.
The reason I don't think of my friend group as my friends is because we're all misfits. We don't belong anywhere else so we go there. We're friends out of necessity, and deep down, I think we all know that. But I can't leave, and I can't ask them for help, and my only other friend is the girl I told I liked 5 months ago who used to be my best friend. Now we barely talk. 
I'm honestly just terrified of the future. I'm not the type that makes friends easily, and I'm a bit of an asshole. Why the fuck can't I just be normal? I know people who don't fear the time they're left with their own thoughts. Why isn't that me?"

Which brings another stupid question: is it possible to ask a therapist to just stick with clinical criterias for depression or would one absolutely need to expand on my personal feelings ?
I mean, if there is no reason for one's depression, one shouldn't really have to speak about his relationship with people or more intimate things. 
One should be able to stick to ""it's been 10 years and I'm dead inside and I break down and cry randomly and frenetically and want to jump down every time I see a train etc... ""

This stupid virus has me at probably my lowest point in a LONG time. I’m in college, all my classes got moved to online I don’t do well online, the tests are done using a program that can tell if you’re cheating it literally just records you and even YOUR EYE MOVEMENTS and the professor can just watch you and that alone stresses me out. I’m TERRIFIED I’m going to lose my job because there is talk of closing down the school and all it’s services and GUESS WHAT I WORK FOR THE SCHOOL AS A TUTOR. And I have an apartment and I can’t just break the lease and move home with my family because that’s not a thing with student apartments they’ll just charge my co-signer which is my aunt and then she’ll be mad at me and never trust me again. And I’m obviously living in the apartment because I have to pay for it but all my roommates are gone and I have nobody which makes my depression worse. My mom was honestly worried I would attempt again but this time there’d be nobody to save me. I thought I would be okay here because I’ve been going to therapy and I was doing much better before the whole virus thing and I was making improvements so I thought it would be beneficial to continue that but I found out that they’re closed indefinitely because they’re also a part of the school. I feel lost and helpless. I looked into online therapy and it’s so expensive. My college is in a super small town so there aren’t many mental health professionals in the area and when you consider the fact that I don’t have a car there are even fewer to choose from and I would need to be able to talk to someone who can deal with my multitude of problems (anxiety, depression, and ocd)I just have so many unanswered questions and so much stress  and the one thing I was relying on is completely gone I feel lost.
