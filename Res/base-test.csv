I get that that may seem like a low number but I'm really sensitive to pain so I was actually on the verge of passing out on the last cut. Everyone I've told is absolutely pissed. My girlfriend and I had a rule where if one person cuts, the other is allowed to. Normally it keeps us both from cutting but recently she's been in a hellhole and she needed relief. I tried to stop her, I really did, but she insisted that she would do it even if it ruined the promise. My girlfriend also wanted some space recently, so she hasn't been available to help. I also recently just left the group of friends I had been in due to toxicity and mistreatment of mental health issues. I only have one person so far who has provided genuine support."

And that's kind of where I feel myself going right now. I'm exhausted and overwhelmed but also overwhelmed, and I'm starting to feel the joy flicker out. My last day off from both jobs was Feb. 20th &amp; my next day off isn't until March 19th, and even though I only have a week left until I get there, it's one day and then I'm back to at least 1-2 weeks with no day off. I'm feeling burned out from work, and between never having a lot of time or every, and my insecurities I've been struggling to eat. I've struggled with an eating disorder for a long time on my own and sometimes when I get depressed I forget to eat and then when I do get hungry I feel guilty. Stupid, I know, but it is what it is. Okay so now that you have some backstory/context of what I'm feeling, here's my current problem; 
I've sparked up a friendship with this guy recently (met through reddit, he's British &amp; I'm American) and as silly as it sounds I just connected with him so well. We've been talking every day for a few weeks and we send each other snapchats &amp; voice memos all the time. We've both already admitted to having a crush on each other but we're still just friends &amp; we do a lot of encouraging each other as he seems to deal with similar emotions &amp; doesn't get a lot of sleep. We both always dread work and feel exhausted by our day but today for me was just draining on such an intense level that didn't really hit me until I got home. I want to talk about it with him since I don't feel like I have anyone else to talk to but he told me about how good his day way &amp; how positive he's feeling and I really really don't want to ruin that for him. It makes me really happy that his day was so good &amp; he deserves to sit in that positivity. I don't want him to have to comfort me or feel bad for me, but it's just hard not telling anyone. So here I am, using reddit as a way to get it out of my system. I try so hard to find ways to feel good and stay hopeful when I feel myself getting into that's his negative state of mind but it's just so hard when the work I put into it comes up with very small results. I just wish I could sink into the floor for a month or so then come back up when things start feeling more lighthearted."

It made me less of a ""loser/loner"" and more of a ""regular kid"" which is awesome for a teenager, BUT.
As I said I make a lotta jokes about myself, and people think that they can too, seems logical, yet it isn't, I can't take it, people make fun of everything I do. Even when I find the courage to tell them I'm not ok, which is hard considering I got SA, they somehow making fun of it later on.
One time one girl I really thought was one of my best friends, along with a tiny bit of help from her friends, single handedly managed to make try to jumper under a speeding car (I didn't get hurt). It didn't seem like me, I never thought I would try to kill myself, even in my darkest times. 
Shit got worse when her two friends were trash-talking me directly in front of me, while I was in midst of a mental breakdown that nobody was even remotely trying to stop. They said that they were dissappointed about my ""asshole behavior"", which was literally a fucking mental breakdown FFS.
There hasn't been much lately, and things seem like they're going a bit more smoothly, but I've missing these long writing sessions on reddit's finest rant subs. And I still feel very bad and lonely, so I thought I'd share with other people who are in kinda the same boat."

I'm a 22 (almost 23) year old trans women engaged with my girlfriend of three years, and together we have a one year old son. I love them both more than anything. 
However with an active life of work, fiance, and taking care of a child, I feel incredible amounts of stress. It always seems like on my days off there's just one more thing to take care of, or an errand that requires my time. I usually don't have that much free time as I'm constantly busy with keeping my family afloat. Don't get me wrong, I love my family, they mean the world to me, but holding it all together is taking its toll on me. 
On top of that I have depressive and gender dysphoric episodes. I feel that my depression stems from ""not being good at anything."" I want to be good at... something. At this point, I'll take anything. My two major hobbies are competitive Super Smash Bros Melee, and I get sad about constantly losing, but I also don't internalize that sadness as much because I don't take it super seriously and its more for fun than anything (though watching your rank on the constant decline on the community leader board can really be a bummer at times). My other major Hobby that I am more concerned about is drawing. I've been taking art classes since I was in 7th grade and I was even in AP art. I constantly have a feeling that I'm never improving. 2010-2015 I used to draw for school, and some for fun fan art stuff on the side when I was a nerdy teenager, but 2015 through now, I've hardly done anything. I've made maybe like 3 or 4 completed pieces of digital art and even then I'm not that confident about them. When ever I try to draw today, I just get like, almost physically I'll. I feel like my stomach drops and my heart rate goes up. At work, I have a lot of free time and I try to practice on yellow stickie notes at work but most of the time I usually crumple them up and toss them because I end up not being satisfied. I know that's kinda considered a no no in the art community, but I've been doing this ever since I got a three out of five on my final AP Art portfolio. I tore up a myriad of my AP art portfolio because a lot of it involved self portrait and those drawings of myself were before I even transitioned to female. I want so bad to find time to practice my art, but not even that, just being able to know and internalize that it doesn't have to be perfect, and mistakes are part of learning. But everytime I get to work I just get really really fucking sad and I feel like I'm not ever going to improve because I've been at this for 10 years now. What's particularly upsetting to me is that I have ADHD, so focus is already a big issue. I want to hone in my attention on my art, but get so discouraged when I see people have actually completed a number of sketchbooks, meanwhile I struggle to even get one started and even when I do get started on one, I fill in like two or three pages and then don't pick one up again for months. Digital art is also a big frustration as the number of tutorials, art styles, tricks, etc. are just endless on the internet and with someone like me, it's hard to sit down and actually learn. I can't make it through 5 minutes through an art tutorial of any sort because I just..
 I dunno... get antsy and go watch a Melee clip or a video essay. I don't know how I can easily sit through an hour long video essay about Marxism or whatever, but the moment it comes to the things I really care about, I just can't force myself to pay attention and absorb the learning material. 
I have a long shot dream of making a Sci-Fi cartoon one day. I don't know how to even come close to it considering I can't pay for college, let alone negotiate (argue) medical Bill's with my insurance company in relation to my transition, being barely able to afford the means to keep my family stable, not having enough time to practice, and even if I find time to practice, I just don't out of anxiety or contempt of self. 
It depresses me that I can rationally argue that my dream won't come true and that I'm just going to work a bullshit job for the rest of my life because I just can't get it together. I have days of crying spells where I sit in the shower and have crying fits over gender Dysphoria, depression, and just feeling like a massive failure. 
TL;DR: I suffer from ADHD, Gender Dysphoria, and a busy schedule. I feel those things are getting in the way of me improving at hobbies I want to otherwise improve at, and I feel like a failure for not being able to meet goals"

I’ve done research online and shit and I can’t find anything with a solid answer. Some places say I am depressed and some places say that I’m not depressed. 
3 months ago, my girlfriend broke up with me and is currently getting back with her ex, and every day I think of her. I’m jealous and upset all the time and would do anything to get her back. Whilst we were dating, she used to occasionally speak to her ex online, I didn’t mind because I trusted her, I had no problem with her casually speaking to other men.
But the problem was that the day she broke up with me, she was speaking to him online. So whilst I’m there crying my eyes out, she’s speaking to him and I don’t know how I feel. It’s like she never wanted to be with me in the first place. Things were going so well between us, we hardly argued and we didn’t have an argument 6 or so months prior to us breaking up.
I don’t feel happy anymore, like it used to be the case where I was always happy and I would have the occasional bad day but it’s the opposite now, like I’m always having a bad day and there’s only a few moments when I’m happy - it fucking sucks.

I used to self harm a bit maybe like 5-6 years ago but I stopped for a while, but I never felt depressed and I had no reason to self harm, but I’m just getting all these feelings all at once, and I’m not sure if I can say for sure if I’m depressed or not, but I haven’t been happy for a whole day in 3 months, and I feel like my girlfriend never loved me because of the situation with her ex. I feel betrayed and alone and the only thing that makes me happy is hanging out with my friends which I can’t do because they don’t want to hang out half the time.

Due to medical circumstances we have had to put some of our life plans on hold and I have suffered from some sort of depression the last year.

But at the same time I somewhat suspect that I wouldn't´t be happy even if I took that jump into the unknown. And I´m hesitant do alter to much in my life atm of the big stuff, as long as I´m not feeling that great bc I don´t want to regret it later when I´m back at being myself. But at the same time I somewhat know that I have to alter stuff to get out of this depression and situation I´m in. So I´m kinda just stuck, booth physical and emotional atm, and it just sucks and is eating me up from the inside. But apparently I have a to good poker face for it to show, which even my psychiatrist says, don´t know if I should take it as a compliment or not. I just don´t like showing feelings to strangers, not to anybody really so I just bottle the most things up. Which I know isn´t good, but I suck at handling my own emotions.

My girlfriend wrote me this letter and agreed to share it here... 
Letter to my depressed lover.
I see you. I know you’re in there. The man who loved and sought joy, the man who felt
deserving of happiness. He is blindfolded, held hostage, cold and chained in a windowless
basement, by a tyrant who thrives off suffering. At times it feels like there is no hope, at
times it feels like there is no escape. You are weakened, the exhaustion has taken over your
body, your mind and your soul, you question whether you’ll ever be strong enough to fight
this mighty tyrant, to escape from his grip, out of the darkness. Will you ever be able to feel
the sun stroking your skin again? Will you ever see the light again? Will you ever feel love
again?
Why are you here? How did you get here? You never asked for this, no one would.
A tyrant is an illegitimate ruler who controls through oppression. Tyranny is not fair, it is not
understanding, and it is cruel. The tyrant wants to weaken you until you have no choice but
to succumb, he will brainwash you until you come to terms with his reign, until you are no
longer a threat to him. The tyrant wants you to think that he is too strong to ever beat, too
mighty to outthink, too present to escape.
But let me tell you something about Tyrants. Anger, hate, always stems from fear, and pain.
Behind every tyrant is a hurt child. Behind every tyrant is a voice that was once unheard, a
heart that was once broken, eyes that were once blinded. The tyrant doesn’t want you to
see the light, because the light was once taken from him, he doesn’t want you to know love,
because love was once taken from him, and he wants you to hurt, because he hurts.
But how can tyranny be defeated? When tyranny is defeated by force, it often just paves
the way for another form of tyranny. You don’t want to kill your tyrant, you’ll be left with
blood on your hands and trauma in your soul, if you kill you’ll have to hide, and what is the
point of fighting your way out of the darkness, just to make your way into another form of
darkness?
No. Your tyrant won’t be defeated by force. He will be defeated by love, and I know that
your love is strong enough to turn him around.
The man that I love finds joy in the little things, the touch of the grass against his feet, the
sight of birds in the trees, the sound of a stick falling on icy water. The man that I love is
surprising, he is unapologetically original, passionate, and doted of a natural humour. The
man that I love is caring and has an emotional intelligence that can make anyone around
him feel seen, heard, and loved. The man that I love is wise, he can offer advice that you
never knew you needed, and he can be the ray of sunshine in anyone’s day. The man that I
love will lighten up entire rooms and soothe even your deepest worries with care and
attention. The man that I love, can love so strongly, so unconditionally, so powerfully, that
he can make anyone’s darkness fade away. So, if anyone is going to bring this tyrant down,
it will be the man that I love.
Love can make your tyrant feel seen, it can make him feel comfortable enough to talk,
comfortable enough to tell you about what pain led him to tyranny. When faced with love,
with a powerful, unconditional love, and an acceptance that is free of all judgment, your
tyrant will be able to start facing up to his actions, he will be able to start realising that all
along he was causing you to suffer for reasons that had nothing to do with you, they were
never your fault, he was only causing you to suffer, because he was suffering. When that
realisation will spring upon him, he will remove your blindfold and you will see that you are
facing yourself. But don’t worry, it’s just a mask the tyrant originally wore to trouble you, he
won’t wish to do that anymore though, he’ll unchain you and remove his mask, and you will
realise that all along, your tyrant was only a child. Suddenly the anger you felt towards your
tyrant will vanish, because you are a man who is fair, just and loving, you are a man who
doesn’t believe in punishment nor revenge, you are a man who can forgive. You are a man
who can recognise when a child simply needs to be held, loved and nurtured.
So you will take the child’s hand. At first, he will be fearful, he has been hurt before, who’s
to say that you won’t hurt him? But you will give him your word, you will promise him that
he is safe with you, and deep in your heart, you will know that you are telling the truth. The
child will weep in your arms, and you will hold him tighter, you will tell him that he is loved,
he is heard, he is seen, and that from this moment forward, he will never be alone.
You will come out of the basement with the child, hand in hand. And although at first it will
feel like a relief, it won’t be easy. You haven’t seen the sun in so long, its light will feel
blinding and uncomfortable, your body will still feel weak, and as you’ll barely feel able to
look after yourself, you’ll start to wonder how you could possibly look after this child? But
you will surprise yourself. Through the small pleasures you once enjoyed, such as feeling the
cool grass underneath your feet, you will find strength. Enough strength to lift yourself up,
carry the child, and start walking. It will be challenging, and you’ll worry that each step
might be your last step, you’ll worry that you might fall and never find the strength to get
back up, but you’ll keep putting a foot in front of the other, until it starts to feel natural.
Eventually you’ll look up and realise that the sun isn’t as blinding as it was when you first
came out, you’ll see a path, and you’ll know how to get home.
On your way home, you will worry that bringing this child back might be too much of a
burden for me. What if I don’t want him? What if I don’t love him? After all he was once a
tyrant, how could I love him? And what if I don’t even love you anymore? You’ve been gone
for so long, what if I’ve stopped waiting? What if I’ve given up? What if I’ve found someone
else? What if I just end up hurting you and the child more than you’ve both already been
hurt?
But all this time, I’ve been waiting for you. I’ve been worrying, I’ve been crying, you
disappeared so suddenly I never understood what had happened. I made it my mission to
find you, I was up day and night trying to save you, I called on you a thousand times, I
searched for clues in every corner, I even tried to negotiate with your tyrant, but to no avail,
it only angered him more. I tried to get help, but no one could help me, and in the end, I was
left weakened. That’s when I realised that I was exhausting myself, and I wasn’t helping you.
So I did the only thing I could do. I stopped trying to save you and trusted that you would be
able to save yourself, and as I waited for you to do that, I held our space, I nourished our
space so that you could come back to a loving and nurturing home, one where you could
one day feel whole again and heal.
When you come home, I will welcome your little boy with open arms, and love him, just as I
learned to love the little girl who once held me hostage in a basement. The truth is I already
know your little boy, I’ve seen him in your shadows, and I’ve already grown to love him. You
also know my little girl, she has been living in our home throughout our entire relationship.
She has loved you as much as I have, and although at first she was afraid of you, she was
afraid that you would hurt her, she grew to love you, and she learned to trust you. When
you were gone for so long, she began to worry, she worried that perhaps you would never
come back, she worried that perhaps you didn’t want to come back to us, perhaps you
wanted another home, a different home, perhaps you had stopped loving us.
But I reassured her, and I told her about the love that we shared, the hours and days we
spent looking into each other’s eyes, as time stood still and the world around us vanished,
and we questioned, every day, how we could be so lucky. Our love is the truest love I’ve
ever known, our love is the deepest love I’ve ever known, and I know that a love like ours,
never just goes away.
One day my little girl will meet your little boy, and they will love each other as much as we
love each other, the four of us will build a home so whole, that all our fears will be replaced
by trust, our anger will be replaced by love, and tyranny will be nothing but a distant
memory.
This isn’t going to happen overnight, we don’t want you to exhaust yourself trying to come
home, we don’t want you to run and fall, we want you to make wise and calculated steps, so
that you can slowly but surely come back to us.
If I could, I would be in the basement with you, but you don’t want me there, and if I force
myself into the basement, my little girl will turn into a tyrant again and our home will
collapse. So although I’m not in the darkness with you, know that I can still see you, and I
am still here, holding our fort, waiting for you to find the strength to love your tyrant
unconditionally, so that you can bring him home for us to nurture and heal him, so that he
can learn to fearlessly trust both of us."

68,0.7724609375,0.09283447265625,-1.2841796875,0,0,"Emotional Depression vs Chemical Depression &amp; how the mind reacts : Many of you probably know this but just in case...
If you have emotional depression, it's because something bad happened recently.  You lost your job and bills are piling up, your best friend died, you lost a child, whatever.  It's an emotional response to a life event.  Things suck right now, but they can and will get better because of time.  You aren't the first person to be in this situation, you won't be the last person. Hang in there, get what help you can.
If you have chemical depression, it's because your body isn't making the right amount of the right chemical, or it's going through the right chemical but too quickly, etc.  This is like having diabetes. It's not caused by an event, it's not a reaction to something which has happened or is likely to happen. It's a medical condition that you need medicine to control.  Yes, some people can achieve help with diet changes, some people can exercise their way out, but in all cases it's still a bio-chemical problem.
Talk therapy is not going to fix chemical depression.  Changing jobs is not going to fix chemical depression.  Having kids is not going to fix chemical depression.
Now, here's the kicker -- your brain is fucking stupid. It does not control the body, it justifies the body. If you eat a pizza and then later feel sick, your brain decides it was the pizza.  It may be that you have the flu and the pizza has nothing to do with it, but your brain is looking for cause and effect, so until it gets convinced otherwise, you hate pizza.
Another example:  You think you're drinking decaf, but your actually drinking an energy drink. You get the jitters.  You much be scared of something.  Something bad must be about to happen because otherwise why would you have the jitters.  OMG! You're psychic! You know something bad is about to happen!  Yeah, no. You're brain is stupid. That's all.
Well, the exact same thing is true with chemical depression.  Your bio-chemistry says ""you are depressed!"" so your brain says, ""Oh, it must be because.... um.... I hate my job! Or it's because I don't have a girlfriend! No, no, I know! My friends all hate me!""
So, when you're feeling down, ask yourself objectively: am I depressed because something is wrong, or am I depressed because my brain is stupid?
If you are feeling depressed and its made worse because there's no good reason for you to be depressed, you likely have chemical depression and should talk to a doctor about getting pills.  You can't talk therapy your way out of chemical depression."

I’m a happy person, always laughing or smiling. You’ll never see me with a sad face or in a grumpy mood. However, on the inside, I’m sad. I’m lost. I’m confused. I’m hurt. I feel like giving up. I feel like no one cares about me. I’m always asking my friends how they are, how their day went, and comforting them when they’re upset. They’re there for me and I’m there for them. I know that, but I can’t get myself to open up. I don’t want people to see my upset or to know about my problems. I hide my feelings and don’t let them out. I’m insecure, I’m sad, and I feel ugly, but do people know that? No. Never.  I feel like I’m stuck inside my own thoughts, alone, and not cared for.
It’s the moments when I’m all alone is when things get fucked up the most. My thoughts subjugate everything. I start asking question like, Who is really there for me? Do people really care about me?

# the relationship
My girlfriend (18) and I (18) started dating 2 years ago at 16 back in high school. We've had a very turbulent relationship with a lot of breaking and making up, intense love and our fair share of troubles. Maybe I'm just romanticizing the word toxicity but to be completely honest I wouldn't have wanted it any other way.
We used to be extremely jealous of each other and sort of isolated our self from the world together. Thinking back I do regret this a lot. Due to our mix of toxicity and her depression we both suffered abuse from each other. It's crazy how an extreme love for a certain person can drive you insane and even make you do unloveable things to them.
In high school we used to spend almost everyday together and I loved it this changed after we went to college. When we graduated high school she went to Sweden for 7 weeks and we really started having a lot of relationship difficulties from there. I sort of started disconnecting and getting used to having more space. After she returned we noticed that we had both changed a lot and this led to a lot of fights but slowly but surely we kind of started having a healthy relationship. This took a lot of hard work, sacrifice and communication.
Everything changed when this happened however. Around the first year of the relationship we both promised each other to stop watching porn because it made us insecure. I did this for a long time but eventually relapsed around 8 times in the span of a year and never told her. She eventually had a suspicion and confronted me, I confessed and everything just went extremely downhill from there. She was really hurt and even more so about the fact that I hid it from her and was never planning on telling. We broke up after this but got back together after a couple weeks had gone by. Her trust however was never the same (and rightfully so).
# Her situation/depression
My girlfriend originally started suffering from depression at 16 due to her birth control pills. I've been supporting her ever since. The first months it was really bad and she even tried taking her own life with sleeping pills she saved up. I called emergency services when this happened and she was taken to the hospital and given mental treatment after this all happened. There was a big problem however when she came home.
After hating me for a couple of days and wishing that I didn't call emergency services she finally told me the real reason why she wanted to die. It turns out that she was a gypsy, a Romani. And in their culture children have to be in arranged marriages at extremely young ages. Now its 16/18 but it used to be a lot younger. And it has to be with another gypsy otherwise the female is considered a whore and an outsider and is shunned by the entire family. I always thought that my girlfriend had strict parents but never to this extent I never asked any questions about why they couldn't know about us but now I knew.
She always had a really good relationship with her mom but after the day she tried to commit suicide their relationship was strained for a very long time. Her mother (father is out of the picture) didn't believe in mental health and thought she was doing this to get attention which of course triggered my girlfriend even more. She also could never tell the full story to her mental health counselors because they would have to enable child protective services.
She eventually made the choice to run away with me. But she seemed very conflicted about this and kind of flip flopped between staying with her mom and living for her and being with me. A lot of the times she did not want to make a choice because she felt she would be unhappy in both situations. A loveless (probably abusive) arranged marriage or an unstable relationship with me. She convinced herself dying was the best option eventually. I talked her out of it so many times and truly tried supporting her through everything. This took a large toll on me as she would often be really abusive.
Everything changed when I cheated however. She told me in the weeks that we broke up that I was the reason she was going to die and I was her only chance at a normal life. I tried to convince her otherwise but she just won't listen. After we got back together she told me she was going to die regardless of her relationship and she's just waiting for the right time. When I begged her not to she refused to change her choice and told me it was going to happen this year and I get to choose to be with her till the end or leave. When I asked why she said because I cheated and we would never be the same after this anyway.
I thought I could change her mind at first but I can't. I honestly don't know what to do anymore I see a future with this girl but she doesn't with me. I told her I'm going to think about my choice and she called me selfish. Supporting her through all of those years of this took a toll on my sanity,sleep and social life. I can't sit there and be with her until she dies. I don't understand how she wants to take me back after everything but doesn't want to run away with me anymore. I'm confused tired and stressed out. I've never talked about this with anyone and I just need to hear someone else's opinion on this.
# My final decision
I still havent decided what to do and told her I want to think about this long and hard. She told me I was selfish and compared me to the devil for leaving her with the depression and letting her die alone. I really need some advice.
I really don't want to be a temporary comfort for her I just can't. I love her to death and want to grow old with her and have a good relationship. I would permanently lose my sanity if I stayed I'm afraid but I also don't want to leave her like this.
I know a large part of our relationship troubles seem really immature and they are. But we were both really young and we still are and these are all just extremely hard choices to make at this age.
TL;DR: My girlfriend is going to kill herself and wants me to be with her till the end. I'm conflicted on what to do."

We became close friends and eventually friends with benefits. I was looking for more of a real relationship with her but whatever, fuck it. At this time I legit only had 3 friends left. My fwb (let's call her K) and two others. 
2020 came by and my two other friends decided to ditch me. We dont hang out anymore and they dont even contact me unless I contact them first.      Whatever. I still have K, right? We have a weird relationship. She knows that she can give me minimal attention and I'd stick around, but we hang out basically every day. 
She's using me. I know she is. But fuck, I just enjoy being in someone's company. I'm so fucking desperate for companionship of any kind that I'm literally breaking my back to do everything for this girl. And I honestly dont mind it  I really like her and enjoy being around her, and she seems to feel the same way. 
Recently the past days she's been distant. I know I'm losing her. It fucking sucks. It wouldn't be so bad if I had someone to talk to, but I dont. She doesn't even give me the time of day to respond. What the fuck could I have done wrong. 
So I've decided that if I have no one, I might as well die. If I for sure lose K, I'm as good as dead.

Now I’m at the point we’re i truly 100% couldn’t care less if I lived of died. I have no idea what I’m doing with life anymore or why I’m doing the things I’m doing. For a long time I was In a very dark place. A place beyond crippling depression. Almost like feeling like your crazy but aware of it and there’s nothing you can do to fix it. In that time in my life I didn’t have a single person that genuinely cared about me. Even my parents took every chance they could to make it worse. They knew what I was going though and would tell me they know even though I denied it then they’d just start saying to worse possible things to me to just complete crush my confidence and will to live. It’s almost like they were trying to push me to go completely insane with the things they’d say. They would do things then when I brought it up they’d pretend it never happened and tell me there must be something wrong with my brain because my reality doesn’t match there. All that was a few years ago and it got a little better for a little but it still messes with my head a lot now. I went through years with that having nobody care about me and having my parent treat me the way they did. Plus I was doing a bunch of hard drugs during that time like that long prescription pain pills and Xanax and worst of all smoking a lot of k2. After so log of not being cared about when I went of and started hanging out with friends I just couldn’t feel that they or anyone else really cared about me. Even know I know I have people in my life that care about me I just can’t feel it. Even if they make is it obvious they care I can’t feel it. After so many years of not feeling any real actual love from anyone it’s like if completely lost the ability to feel love. Now all On my way! Feel is sadness and anger. It takes a lot of me to get angry but when I do I just go nuts and start doing and saying this that I shouldn’t and I always regret it in the end.  I know my friend care about me because they show me all the time but I just can’t feel it. It’s theworst  fucking thing ever. It’s like a curse. My dad use to beat me a little when I was younger. It wasn’t really anything too bad but it was beyond a regular beating. Anyway I’m not bringing that up to complain about that too cuz no I don’t care about that I was really young and it doesn’t really affect me. I bring it up because I would rather go though those beatings every day that constantly go though this mental torment. I just hope somehow someway something come into my life that makes me feel loved or gives me my will to live. I wouldn’t commitsuicide  but idk I Just can’t handle this too much longer. After years of having theses peoples and just suppressing them I feel like I actually starting to go schizophrenic. I know nobody is gonna be able to really held so I don’t even know why I’m posting is people are just gonna give the same old generic  “we love you” comments I guess I just thought to vent on here for a try.

I'm supposed to write this journal everytime I wake up but I wasn't able to manage my time efficiently earlier. Still trying to make this a habit.

Every night I feel a different kind of tiredness that at times I could sleep without even changing my clothes. I woke up with my newly washed and dried clothes still unfolded at the side of my bed. It's been there for a few days already. 

The first thing I did in the morning was read the messages from a guy I'm getting to know now (he's helping me in what I'm going through cos he makes me feel that there's still a guy who can be interested with me...maybe pathetic to hear from others but it doesnt matter what others say anyway. I'm happier having him but not attaching too much of myself for now). Then I read some posts that would make me feel better...in this community perhaps. It feels good that people are helping and not being judgmental to each other. It took me some time to move and get going to start my day.

I forced myself to get up, fold my clothes, fix my bed. Then I organized my closet, threw the rubbish. After I was done cleaning, I felt so good. It was like a feeling of big relief. I appreciated the sunlight coming into the windows even. 

Happy to start a refreshing day! Already at work now. Write to you tmr again. 😊"

On a quick search of reviews I can see people are saying the efficacy of 5-HTP is very high, but the scientific evidence is it is not. 
Digging deeper, it was not difficult to find some unique use cases for 5-HTP one of them was people using it on a comedown for MDMA. If you read them threads youll realise that there must be truth to this as there is no advantage for those guys to recommend that for sales or other.
Further, Drs will deny 5HTP value but recommend not to take with SSRIs as this will cause serotonin syndrome.
It is therefore my opinion that the mechanisn for this is using a drug with inhibits the reuptake of serotonin (SSRI) in conjunction with a substance that increases the level of serotonin in the body in general (5-HTP) that causes this issue.
Back over to MDMA, we know that this drug will inhibit the reuptake of serotonin, dopamine and noradrenaline in huge quantities. The risk to taking 5HTP too early on the comedown is highlighted by many users. I think its obvious to add this point to say that it is by the same mechanism that 5HTP helps on a comedown. The potency of the MDMA is decreasing as it goes past its half-life. The 5 HTP pushes a surge of serotonin into the system and the drug can still use that as the MDMA effects become weaker. Easing the withdrawl symptoms of MDMA.
Another possible onservation to be made at this point. The people who find relief from 5HTP alone will have issues PRODUCING serotonin but not in the bodies efforts to regulate the neurotransmitter. For those where 5HTP alone does not work it is because the body isnt able to do anything useful with the serotonin in the system.
Cue St Johns Wort, according to research this works similarly to SSRI for both serotonin and dopamine. In fact adding tyrosine into the mix could potentially increase the leves of dopamine also as it is its precursor. In theory a mix of 5HTP and st johns wort could be as effecting as presciption medication."

I should probably start this by saying that I don't think I have depression or a mental illness or anything like that, but I've never been sadder and lately I just haven't felt like myself and I wasn't sure where else to turn to for advice. 
So there's this girl in my close friend group who I have feelings for but she has made it pretty clear that she doesn't have an ounce of interest, although she still wants to be friends (idek if we're still friends though). Our relationship has become really awkward and strained and I feel like every move I make is the wrong one and makes it even worse.
Lately she's been feeling down and it makes me miserable to see her miserable, and I feel helpless knowing all my efforts to make her feel a bit better haven't done much. Everytime I think about this though I'm reminded of how little I'm worth to her compared to how much I care about her, and it's become this cycle of sad thoughts every night. 
At the same time, I've been dealing with some personal stuff and the little things I once appreciated just aren't as nice anymore. I don't even enjoy the stuff I once enjoyed. Like I recently hung out with my friends but as time went on I kinda just wanted to go home more and more. They're all great people though and they've given me good advice on how to move on, but it's proving harder than I originally thought. When I get home now, tbh I just sleep because at least in my dreams I don't have to face reality. I feel broken and don't have much motivation to do anything. 
At first, I thought it was slowly getting better but I came to the realization that it isn't after I started feeling sad sometimes at school, even though before I only really felt sad late at night. It's almost like it just accumulates over time. 
I'd really appreciate any input on what I'm feeling rn. Anything helps. Also, thanks to whoever took the time to read the entire thing"

And i have readed some that describe situations where depression isn't validated at all, or feel themselves that they don't deserve to feel better, which obviously doesn't help. I feel that way too, but the more fucking disgusting thing is that I already have been a year in home, doing nothing but going to several therapists, and even then, I didn't progress even a bit, because or he/she doesn't ask me to give my opinion or express myself, or he/she doesn't speak a word and i have to progress myself from almost nothing, if you have been to a psychoanalyst you'll know what im talking about.
 And it's already difficult to talk about it, even more when you feel that you are complaining for nothing, and you are afraid to say that you are not following what he/she said you to do at all because it's hard. And that's exactly what encloses you in a loop, thinking you don't deserve to be comprehended, not communicating with your therapist and lying about your progress, not progressing because of that, and feeling more guilty. I don't know if I have expressed myself correctly and can be understood, but that's what i can say at the moment. 
I'm conscient of the depression symptoms, but even so it's a constant fight against your thoughts and the way your reasoning works, and every hour i change between thinking that it's reasonable to feel bad, and feeling guilty for it. I  don't know who's fault is I'm afraid to tell my therapist how I really am, well, actually now I say it, it's probably beacuse the first therapist i've been in my life and I've been again last year is fucking rude, and it's the same my father has been going to untill the beginning of last year... for like 15 years.

I was walking around thinking about my dog and I'll do so much fun stuff with him. As I was walking I was so deep in my thoughts I didn't realize where I was going and bumped into someone. For the life of me, I bumped into the biggest jackass in my school. For privacy reasons, we'll call him Earl. Earl loved to be a complete asshole to me. He tells me to watch where I'm going and called me a dumbass. The thing about Earl is he's easily pissed off if I act smart with him so I did exactly that because my day has been absolute hell. I'm not the greatest at comebacks so I said what anyone who wouldn't know what to say. No u. He got so pissed that he shoved me on the ground with the force of a bull. I hit my head pretty hard on the ground but I was able to get back up without hesitation. I've hit my head so many times it doesn't affect me that much. One of my friends, for privacy reasons we'll call him Ernie. Ernie noticed some red liquid in my hair. I was bleeding from my head. By this point, there was a huge ass circle between Earl, Ernie, and I. Earl swung at me and hit me dead center in my stomach. I fell to the ground gasping for air. Earl knocked the air out of me. Now I know what you're thinking, wouldn't the school have stopped this by now? No. I go to a ghetto school where none of the adults care about what the kids do and that includes fights. I was gasping for air trying to breathe. While I was on the ground gasping for air I called Earl a son of a bitch. Earl was about to charge me while I was on the ground but Ernie knew he had to jump in or something terrible was going to happen. Ernie jumps in and tackles Earl to the ground. Ernie was on top so he began to punch Earl in the face repeatedly. Kids were yelling and everything. It got to a point where Earl's face was all bloody. Finally, a teacher came out because someone told them what was going on. They separated Ernie and Earl with security guards holding the both of them. The three of us were brought to the office. I had to leave school and go to the hospital so I could get stitches. I don't know what Ernie and Earl are currently at right now. I'm just glad that Ernie jumped in to help me.

He wrote a column a while back about the environmental consequences of the Syrians war.  Given my research focus, I was intrigued. I commented on these satellite photos, in reference to his article, that a silverlining of ISIS has been a reduction in air pollution in Syria.  However, the human cost has been tremendous.  Yet, I remember you also wrote that artillery, bombs, and munitions are causing forest and brush fires, so I may be wrong.
I checked my twitter and had tons of hate messages claiming I was an ecofascist, a war criminal, and I was saying the Syrian Civil War was a good thing. The ring leader was a guy who like me works in sustainability. He paraphrased my comment and claimed that the Syrian War was good because it killed people, and dead people dont create pollution. He then retweeted this and got his followers to dogpile me, telling me to fuck off and saying I am a genocidal maniac.
I apologized. I acknowledged that my comment was callous, and I deleted it. Many of the people who initially went me hate mail apologized to me. My friend, the war correspondent stuck his neck out and told me and his followers that I wasn't a monster. 
However, the initial guy that misquoted me as saying war is good because it kills people and reduces emissions refuses to acknowledge or admit his mistake. I reached out. I apologized. I deleted the comment that triggered him. But he continues bashing me on his twitter. He makes me so mad because he and I work in the same field sustainability.

Currently I really don't have too many friends. At all. I have no friends in real life that I talk to, outside of occasional classmates, and online I have one friend I speak to very very occasionally. She doesn't often like to talk to me too often, which is okay, she makes more of an effort than a lot of other people do. 
Despite knowing I don't really have any close-knit friends, I do try to reach out to people. Whether it be people I used to talk to frequently, or people who I want to try to get to know, I do actively try to talk to people and make new friends. 
But after the first message I just feel insane amounts of guilt and anxiety over it. I get pissed off with myself, internally bereating myself like ""Why the fuck are you sending them a message? You know they don't want to talk to you, if they did they would have said hello in the past 3 years"". 
Then usually when getting replies I feel even worse. They're pretty short ""heys"" or ""cool"" or one word answers I can just feel are the other person going ""literally what do you want from me?""
I feel so goddamn lonely. And I'm constantly in this battle between ""Look just don't talk to anybody at all and only speak when spoken to"" and ""Look you need to make an effort with people for them to like you"". 
And I try to make an effort, but I just can't strike properly with literally anybody. Not online, not even in real life. 
I wish I could stop wanting to have people care about me. I wish I could be okay with just not having anybody in my life. I feel like such a failure even without the fact I can't connect with a single person in my same species.

When i was 13 years old my back then girlfriend who i was really in love with killed herself by hanging herself and i have ptsd since that. I was in contact with a couple of therapists but i dont think they can help me. When i  was around 16 i found another girl who at the time reminded me of myself and i fall in love with her. We had been together for 9 years but i started to threat her badly at the end i dont know why i did this but i did. She became clincal depressed because of me and i could not see me as the reason behind it. She left me around a year ago. I have to say about that that i have extrem social anxiety and dont leave my appartment at any time only in the mornin at around 8am when i have to buy food. My mental state since that has became worse and worse. I started taking drugs and drink alkohol on a daily basis because i cant deal with being responsible for her state. A couple months ago i started to cut myself and had 2 suicide attempts by taking 100 painkillers the first time and around 130 the second time. Right now i am back home from a long walk thinking about jumping infront of a train. I work a deadend job in a office where everyone makes fun of me on a daily basis and i have to pretend that everything is fine or else they fire me because i used to almost get violent against my coworkers when they started to tell me i do this for attention and that there is nothing wrong with me. Every single day of my life is constant agony i wish i would just die. My daily life outside of work consist of playing games and taking drugs/getting high to keep me distracted. On a weekend i spend around 16-20 hours a day on my pc watching series from my childhood and while thinking of better times. I dont know why i really write this shit here but i feel like theres nothing else i can do. I am sry for bothering all of you.

It's like that piece of glass that gets stuck on your foot...and you step on it pushing it further and your skin just grows over it. I then met this guy that made me really happy, and he told me he liked me and I was going to tell him I liked him too.. The whole time he had a girlfriend. I found out through a friend and at first it didn't hurt me. I just went eh it's okay, but then I was going through a bad time and I noticed that I had to start every conversation with him, and that he steadily started ignoring me. We used to play games together, but I noticed he stopped playing with me and stopped talking to all his friends all together and only focused on his girlfriend which I understand. The problem is he started being meaner for no reason and questioning everything I said. I found myself sad again and crying daily for a total of now a month. I'm crying as I'm writing this portion, I thought he was a good friend, I thought I had someone to rely on when I'm sad. He helped me through a lot and we told each other everything.

139,-0.76611328125,2.09765625,-1.6640625,1,0,"The same things that I am thankful for, I can be depressed about the very next day. : I am currently wallowing in my own self pity about things that I KNOW are not the end of the world. But I am unable to convince my subconscious of this. Yesterday, and honestly a lot of the days prior because I need to remind myself how blessed I am or this will happen faster, I was raving about how great my current situation is. I was viewing things from the perspective of how great things are and how much I have to look forward to. But instantaneously those feelings flipped on me today. I only have some semblance of an idea of what triggered this. I was listening to a podcast and they were discussing things they would like to do this summer.  I guess I couldn't handle the idea of somebody doing something I would miss out on, and I began to feel I had no way of keeping up. I want things to come to me effortlessly. I don't take into account that these people are at an entirely different stage of life than I am either. When a depressive mood sets in for me, I am unable to comprehend time. I no longer have the ability to understand that I can do so many things in my life because I'm only 23 and I have so much time to accomplish all of these things. But I guess the ""I am only__ years old thing"" is starting to wear on me. I have only been getting older when saying it without much to show for it. (Of course this isn't true, it's just the way I inexplicably feel). So when I start to think about the fact that I want to travel, or I want to make more friends, have more dates, whatever the case I begin to feel sad. I tell myself all the things that are holding me back from doing so. In my mind, I hate everyone and this is why I can't do this, I have dogs so I can't travel or really leave the house much, and finally it's because I am broke. Aside from me hating everyone, which is a deeper darker thing, the other two things just aren't true. So I really have no idea why I believe them. From this point, I began to nitpick every little thing about my life. Everything that I don't yet have that I feel for whatever reason I deserve. Everything that I have gone through that I feel is a negative is now amplified by 100 in my head. It began to eat away at me. I would like to have the opportunity to travel, I would like to have the opportunity to put myself first, I would like the opportunity to live a full life. This leads me down the rabbit hole of finding an issue with every single thing that exists in my life. Suddenly I wish the dogs weren't ""such a burden on me that I could travel"" though I know this isn't true and there are dozens of ways I could travel despite being a dog owner. I also love them more than anything in the world and I absolutely hate when I use them as a crutch to something that I don't do. I start to be unable to control my emotions and lash out verbally at them and anyone else around me. Which is a trait I gained from my dad and I absolutely hate. I usually am able to recognize it and today I was, and it's usually reminds me that I need to write it out and try to overcome. But when I try to write it out, I find myself getting stuck. I start to feel like I am being disengenuous with myself, and then I get confused about the way I truly feel about things.  
literally all of the things that I am depressed about, I was finding reasons to be grateful for just days prior. But, Suddenly my current living situation isn't enough, and I need to go shop for furniture and decoration and then my funds aren't enough and I need to be responsible and I'm such a piece of shit for being so materialistic. Then my body isn't good enough and all the work I'm putting in, in the gym is for nothing and I'm wasting my time. Then I'm just lonely and I need people around me but ""the universe isn't putting the right people in my life"". The hardest part is knowing that all of this is nonsense and on my good days I can poke holes in all of it. Unfortunately this isn't one of those days and all of those things seem valid to me even as I type.  
Anyway, sorry if I couldn't condense it in a way that made a lot of sense. I really want to be vulnerable and share on here, because I know so many people go through similar things. I really hope that people can relate and feel better. If you read, I hope this resonates with you in a positive way, thank you all for letting me share with everyone today."

I then recalled an article I had read a while ago about adults with ADHD and how I had related to a lot of it, but didn’t think that anybody would believe me at the time, so I never mentioned it to anybody. After all, only kids get diagnosed with ADHD, right? And I had good grades growing up and was never hyperactive so I couldn’t have it, right?
Well. After sending my mom a few articles to read to see if I was crazy for relating so much, she told me that she started crying while reading them because every single thing she read aside from the hyperactivity was something that I had struggled with my entire life, and had frequently stressed about to her, including my anxiety and depression. She told me she felt like she understood now why I could never stick with a habit, and why her seemingly simple solutions for things I was struggling with weren’t working (like how using calendars don’t help me remember things I need to do because I forget to look at the calendar, or how she had to buy me two tracking devices for my wallet and keys because I was losing them so often that I was starting to break down and cry and get angry at myself the moment I misplaced them again, and then I lost one of the tracking devices, or how no matter how many times I organize my things by the end of the week my room is a disaster again). Obviously there is a LOT MORE that I have experienced or struggled with that relate to ADHD or I wouldn’t be so convinced that I might have it, but this would be a much longer post than it is already if I were to copy/paste all of my notes about it here. 
Now, I am NOT SELF-DIAGNOSING, I am seeing a behavioral specialist on Tuesday for my depression and anxiety already. But now I have a huge list of things relating to ADHD that honestly really give me hope that there might be a new beginning in sight.

I never figured out how to get people to like me (I know 'be yourself'. I'm a poor reflection of other people's personalities. Quick aside - I was repeatedly called out in staff meetings and told several times that I have no personality. That I was a flat bore. That a wet dishrag had more emotional range. They gave me extra training to no avail. I couldn't figure out why she was picking on me though, I had the best numbers in the call center).
\*Audience claps\*
Host: Let's get right to it I understand you haven't spent a lot of birthdays with other people, but is there an early one that you can recount?
Me: Well, in the fourth grade, the night before my birthday I stayed at a friend's house. My mom called in the morning to say she was on the way. We were going down to her boyfriend's. I was a big momma's boy. Alright, so = Me and my friend are downstairs watching a movie, but I'm so anxious that I'll miss her that I keep running upstairs to check for her car. It was taking way too long. You know, I'm getting worried. Then, the phone rings. It's my mom. She tells me that they came, knocked, and waited, but no-one answered. She figured I decided that I didn't want to go. So she wrote a note and had my sister put in on the door. I asked her to come back and pick me up, but you know, she couldn't. It would have taken like an hour to get there and another hour to get back. At that point it's too late to take the boat out, so you know, day ruined. Better if they just continue on and I stay with my friend. She promised to call when they were done.
Host: How pathetic
Me: It was dark by then. She wanted me to stay the night at my friend's again because it was late, she was tired, and it was out of the way. I told her that I really wanted to come home. \*Imitates mother\* ""Fine."" But hey, it wasn't all bad. They did save me a slice of cake.
Host: \*laughs\* really?
Me: Yeah, it was pretty nice of them since her boyfriend had bought the cake. Didn't have to give me any. Plus it would have been to hard to bring the whole thing.
Host: ...
Me: ...
Host: Go on
Me: Right. Birthday in the seventh grade, I thought I'd take a three hour round trip bus ride to my old neighborhood to see my old pal and only friend. I called beforehand. Right off the bat he warned I couldn't stay the night. I said that was OK, secretly thinking that if I missed my bus he'd have to let me stay the night. He brought up that it was going to be late by the time I got there, I'd only have twenty minutes to hang out. I went anyway. It was more like five minutes. Heard the laughter as I walked back to the bus stop.
Host: Humiliating
Me: hmph. In the ninth grade my birthday fell on a Sunday and I was big into church. The youth ministers took me to buy church clothes. I was elated. After church they gave me a card with signatures and money.
Host: Boorrrng, yet still pathetic. Any other teenage boy would have hated getting church clothes for his birthday, but you... so starved for affection..
Me: In the tenth grade, my friend from the previous year (we'd moved again) called me to say happy birthday. He asked what I was doing. Which was nothing, of course, He invited me over. He said his mom had gotten a cake. She hadn't.
Host: Oh, is this this the friend that was trying to hook up with yo-
Me: Yeah. That's the one. Quick context - my gf, who had forgot my birthday entirely, would soon break up with me. I was obsessive, possessive, controlling, jealous, the whole stereotype. Well, once she ghosted me, I'd ask my friend if he had seen her, if he could tell her to call me, that I missed her, you know, the usual. He said he hadn't seen her. Didn't talk to her. Might say ""what's up"" in the halls, but couldn't remember. Well, years later I'd reconnect with my ex. Turns out he was trying to get in there the whole time. Told her that he wasn't ever my friend, didn't even like me.
Host: Ok, wrap it up champ.
Me: Young twenties birthday, I went to the casino. The dealer who logged me in saw the flashing birthday notification, he walked over to quietly say happy birthday. He asked what I was doing there on my birthday. I was embarrassed, I panicked. I said I snuck away from a party.
Host: Gross
Me: Another young twenties birthday - driving around, drinking, bathing in self pity. My phone rings. It's my friend: He asks what I'm doing and of course I say \*points to audience\*
Audience: NOTHING!!
Host: \*smiles approvingly\*
Me: That's right, nothing. He invites me to eat with him and his family? I wipe the tears and get the details. Nobody said happy birthday. Come to think of it, he never mentioned my birthday. Was it a coincidence or worse, was it pity? I'll just appreciate the love either way.
Host: Wow, this was sad, but I don't see what the big deal is. Everyone has problems, your's aren't that bad. No wonder nobody likes you. So self centered.
Audience: \*jeers\*
Host: Agreed, Screw that guy. Haha. but seriously, are your birthday's still pathetic?
Me: Good question. I'm not sure the answer. I've learned to cower. I take the day off. I don't advertise my birthday and nobody asks. It's fantastic. I can avoid the shame and embarrassment. There aren't weird looks when I explain that I do nothing on my birthday because work and shopping are my only social interactions. Shoot, I talk to myself more than I talk to others. Full on conversations.
Host: \*laugs\* coo-koo
Me: \*laughs\* No, not a back and forth, More like thinking out loud. I don't want to know why I do it though. To be fair not all of my birthdays are pathetic. There were at least one and a half good ones up there.
Host: One and a half?
Me: I've got more good ones. Like I once tricked someone into being around me
Host: If they were around you obviously they'd been tricked. But, how'd it go?
Me: Oh, the poor deceived soul.. on my birthday she took me on a full day of love. I mean, we did all the things she knew I liked. I blew off dinner with my sister and brother in law because there was absolutely no way this was going to last. Someone showing me affection? They must be stupid.
Host: It didn't and they were. Well that's it for our show today. See you next time.

After telling them to stop a few times over the course of a few weeks and them not stopping, I got fed up and confronted them in a way that burned bridges. We haven't spoken since then and the only other people I talked to in my town were mutual acquaintances that stopped talking to me too. I recently tried to reach out to my old best friend to ask why he did 

I have some really great friends back at college, they're awesome and don't treat me like dirt. The only problem with them is that they live nowhere near me so whenever I'm home, I'm mostly just chilling in my room doing nothing or hanging out with my parents. I'm honestly sick of feeling lonely, but I'm not sure where to start because my town is really small and there's not a lot to do around here. Because of my friends being cruel, I've lost a lot of confidence so it's hard to want to trust people or to meet new people (which I understand is the antithesis of my problem.)

If anyone is going through a similar experience or has advice, I'd appreciate it if you shared/have anything. Thanks and have a good one."

A great friend of her came to the appartement today, she's staying a few days.
Anyways, i went to sleep before them because i was tired, but you know it, couldn't find any sleep. 
I started overhearing a conversation between them and I heard my name.
Now, i've told a lot to my best friend, not most, but still a lot. 
She knows i feel horrible everyday, but she doesn't know how much. So one day we were talking through the phone and it was confession time and... 
I said the most stupid thing i could've ever have said, i said to her that she is reason why i'm still alive. I don't know i was feeling overwhelmed and I just said it. And it's true. She's my heartbeat.
But she said to her friend that what i said put so much pressure on her and that it makes her sad, and I know she is feeling bad too. She feels like everything that i say or do is full of meaning, she feels like i'm not spontaneus anymore. She knows that the only way i have to get relief is getting high. She said that if i kill myself, something will broke, and that she won't be able to live anymore.
WHAT THE FUCK HAVE I DONE I HATE MYSELF
Why did i said that, that's the stupidiest thing i could've ever have said and now i know how she feels about it. 
I'm so sorry. I'm so fucking selfish.
I can't say shit anymore, to anyone. Now i know how much it affects my loved ones. And how it destroys m'y relationship with them. I can never open myself like that anymore, because i'm gonna destroy everyone i love if i do. 
I'm alone now. And now the only thing keeping myself at the verge of life is knowing that if i kill myself, i kill her. This and the fact that, if i keep living, i'm poisining her.

I've suffered depression as long as I (34m) can remember, having led a life filled with trauma. 
This past 4-6 years have been particularly rough, and I have been off work for just over one year now. With a psychiatrist appointment coming up, I've realized that I have little idea what that will entail, what to talk to them about or what is most important to share with them. I may have only one appointment, though I'm not 100% on that. 
Some pointform background: 
- my single parent suffered significant depression
- my parent was hospitalized in a psychiatric facility when I was very young and we were separated for some time 
- I developed nervous tics and anxious behaviour 
- I have since learned about the significant self-harm my parent was engaging in during this time and leading up to the next point
- my parent was diagnosed with Gender Dysphoria and came out to me as trans and gay when I was 11
- i adjusted quickly and had little trouble understanding with the help of therapy and proper information 
- my parent adjusted well, and recovered significantly
- anxiety driven behavior worsens, nervous tics vanish (pre-teen) 
- bullied lots, sometimes very violently (pipes, stabbed) usually related to my family or some assumption that I was also LGBT. 
- some heavy drug and alcohol use throughout teen and early adulthood (MDMA, cannabis, psilocybin, nicotine, alcohol)
- long-time friend drastically increases his involvement with violent neo-nazi group (late teens)
- moved to new city 
- entered into relationship, victim of intense abuse for 8 years (verbal, emotional, psychological, sexual, economic)
- health issues during the abusive relationship: widespread joint pain, off work for depression, injuries at work(including substantial back injury which results in me using a cane periodically to this day), and depression again. 
- minimal therapy after leaving abuse
- off work periodically for a while post-relationship
- first lung collapse at end of 2014 right before big move to new province with current gf (8weeks recovery, life threatening)
- second lung collapse early 2015 (quit smoking, 7 weeks recovery)
- lose job over missed time, health and anxiety
- third lung collapse in early 2016 (6 weeks recovery)
- fourth lung collapse in mid 2016 (6 weeks recovery) 
- fifth lung collapse in January 2017 (6 weeks recovery)
- move to hometown to care for parent after they are diagnosed with stage 3C lung cancer (April 2017)
- parent diagnosed with Stage 3CG1 Colorectal cancer (August 2017)
- sixth lung collapse in February 2018 immediately followed by surgery. Lung wrapped around heart, effectively strangling it. Recovery 3.5 months, ongoing. Never really recovered properly from this. Pain, discomfort, numbness, restricted breathing, fatigue and anxiety persist. 
- Parents diagnosis upgraded to Stage 4C
- Seventh lung collapse in June 2018 (small, recovered with no medical intervention)
- gf's mental health begins to spiral out of control, including an affair with coworker. Her memory of july to september is hazy at best. She stops working August 2018
- gf attempts suicide by overdose. This was my last day of work (Sept 24 2018)
- my 33rd bday (Sept 26 2018)
- parent announces they bought a house and their intent to move 45 minutes outside of town by the end of October 2018 (my gf and I dont drive, and need access to medical care, so we moved into an apartment) 
- 8th lung collapse in January 2019, surgery in mid-February (happens to be one day after my parents major cancer related surgery, after which he is left with an stoma). 5 days in hospital, long recovery. 
- temporary government assistance begins april 2019
My question is, how do I approach this appointment? 
I am not ready to go back to work, at least not in the sense that I ever have, and I am unlikely to resume life the way it ever was. 
I struggle around people to a debilitating degree, I have a hard time leaving my house outside of a handful of reasons, I have no desire to make, maintain or pursue friendships and I havent had any interest in many, many years now. My physical abilities are compromised and I'm exhausted constantly alongside everything else. 
Any input would be so greatly appreciated, as I cannot see my way forward. 
I'm sure to be missing so much, but this is what was immediately significant. 
TL;DR (as best I can) 
Life filled with intense depression, anxiety debilitating trauma and spousal abuse, persistant and crippling health issues, and terminal illness in the family has left me a person I barely recognize. I realize that much can change, but also lots wont. 
How do I approach a psychiatrist appointment and doctors from my new reality and perspective, knowing both I am not ready to go back to work and am unlikely to resume life the way it was?"

I decided to switch to a song that had nothing to do with her. That ended up being Cradle Of Filth - From the Cradle to Enslave. 
Now, when I started the song on Spotify, I ...felt/sensed/noticed this... gods, how do I say this... it was like an external set of ...eyes, looking down into my mind/memories/past and trying to connect the song to something related to my ex.
It felt like a web-crawler. An automated computer program that was 100%, completely and totally untouchable in *any* way conceivable. I could not ""see"" it, I could not talk to it, I could not rationalize it. It was something that felt alien but had to be me. It was going through **rapid fire** ...I hesitate to call them memories but it was like that - images, scenes, memories - but they happened SO fast that I have no memory of them at all. I was able to sense them in a way and that's how I knew they were all tangental to my ex in a weird way.
I am 100% convinced I somehow witnessed my own subconcsious at work trying to either defend or punish me. When I think about it all rationality kinda leaves the scene. There is no sense to be made of it. I could *feel* it working.
Not sure if it was related to my depression or not, but it has never happened before."

203,-1.7802734375,-0.75341796875,2.126953125,2,2,"Coming up on my one year anniversary : I was committed a year ago because I had a detailed plan. Have had major depressive disorder all my life, but it got progressively worse after I was dragged back to work (in a job I hated) two weeks after major surgery, and 8 weeks before my surgeon wanted me to. That's a pain and a weakness I wouldn't wish on anyone. I was in a wheelchair for two weeks so I could still do my job, but I'd feel my muscles tremble from sitting upright after only 30 minutes.
Husband (who can be the world's biggest jerk, and I refuse to defend him in this instance) declared ""I wish you'd just kill yourself when you say you want to"" during an argument that only he wanted to have (he didn't think I should have lunch so he'd have more time to play cards, where his parents were going to feed him. He really sounds like a major abuser, and he was and can still be). I kicked him out that day, and was going to go to work, then come home and take a hot bath. I figured it was the largest chunk of time before I'd be missed.
Luckily, I had a counselor who knew something was horrifically wrong. After prodding, I spilled it all. She helped me get admitted to the hospital and stayed with me until a family member could come take me. I was scared sick, because my mom always stigmatized being committed because it would ""end your teaching career forever."" Can't have that, can we.
While I was in the hospital, it all stopped, and it was insane for me. I knew I hated teaching, and I hated my job. I hated it all so much. I hated that I was constantly called to put my job and my husband's bank account ahead of my own sense of fulfillment. Visiting hours were great, by the way. My mom and sister knew what my husband had said to me, and no one was their usual warm selves to him. In therapy sessions, I talked out what would happen if I abandoned my teaching career. It occurred to me that I still have the people skills, the problem solving, connections, etc, etc. When my certification expires... I don't have to renew it. The idea of a traditional classroom filled me with so much dread...
I told my family, and the same day I was released, I went to my boss (who I loved, it was my big boss that demanded I return to work. She's loved by no one). I didn't bother with changing anything about my clothes, except to put on certain clothing items they confiscated. And I informed her I'd be quitting at the end of the school year. Period. 
Two months into my unemployment, while we were in Japan (long story, don't ask) I was thinking about what my therapist had once asked me: ""What would you do you if you knew you couldn't fail?"" Well, I had wanted to be a veterinarian when I was a kid up until I was 17...and then my depression told me it would never happen. I was that weird kid who mapped out my entire life, and before the internet had a wealth of information on that. I talked to vets, I read every SINGLE book I could find, it was my thing. I was that kid that people would bring their animals to look at, and I could tell them a rough diagnosis, and what kinds of tests they would need to do at the clinic, so they'd be mentally prepared for the bill. Vet school was out, but I had researched veterinary tech programs while I was a teacher: the problem was that they were all full-time programs during the day. But hey, that was no longer a problem! I burst into tears when I realized that I HAD figured out why I needed to stay: I had shlumped into my teaching career because my depression told me I had to. I applied for the only accredited school in my city while we were docked in Tokyo Bay. (Husband, who didn't know me back when I was Weird Animal Girl, thought this was impulsive and out of nowhere. It wasn't until the next morning, when we called my mom, that he realized it wasn't impulse. Mom said ""oh, thank God, that's what I've been waiting to hear for years."" She told my grandpa and his response was ""It's about damn time!!"" He had to realized that oh, no. This was a huge part of my personality he hadn't noticed)
I started classes three weeks later. Every day, I am JAZZED to get to go to class, and even more excited to do the one thing I've always wanted. For the first time since I went into teaching, way back in 2009, I feel hope. I still struggle with depression, obviously, especially because I've lapsed on therapy (fricking copays)...but I maybe found the thing that will keep me going.
Being admitted really did end my teaching career forever."

Just wanted to give some advice to those struggling as they start medication for the first time or are increasing their doses. Since I had a very bad experience with side effects my first time using medication, I thought it would be good to share my tips for getting through this rough period as I try meds again.
Basically, I have three pieces of advice:
1) Go slow. Even if the doctor says increase every 2 weeks, for example, don't blindly follow that if you're experiencing bad side effects. Take twice as long if you need to. When I tried doubling my dose every 2 weeks like the doctor (and official guidelines) recommended, it was hell most of the time. Racing thoughts, insomnia, lethargy, drowsiness, muscle aches, etc. etc. My second go-around with medication, I took twice as long between increases and experienced only mild side effects.
2) Tiny increases. Many doctors (and official guidelines) recommend start higher than you may be able to tolerate. If the prescription is for 10 mg, don't be afraid to start at half of one-quarter of that dose. Same goes for increases. Many doctors and guidelines suggest making 50-100% jumps per increase. When I did that, again, it was hell. But I didn't know better. Don't be afraid to use a pill cutter and make smaller increases as you go up in dosage.
3) Divide doses. If you start feeling wonky after taking a dose, try breaking it up and spreading it out over a few hours for a few weeks until your body gets used to it. There are many who divide their doses into AM and PM, and some who divide them even further. If you're experiencing horrible side effects, you're less likely to continue using medication, and even if you're resilient enough to ride out terrible side effects, why torture yourself and put your job, relationships, and happiness at risk? 
Finally, just listen to your body. Even if ""experts"" tell you one thing, if you're feel like garbage when taking medication, go slow or go small."

My mom was 16 at the time that she gave birth to my sister and left my sister with others so that she could work and go back to school. We don’t have the same dad. Her father was abusive to my mom and she had to experience that first hand and she had to grow up faster than most children. I don’t know a lot of the details because my mom and sister keep that a secret but I’m sure it was traumatizing. My mom is not the most emotionally supportive, in fact she is emotionally abusive and she finds any little negative in every situation. I don’t think she was always this way, I think she became this way after all the abuse from her ex husband. My mom ended up remarrying then had me. I’ve been really lucky to grow up with both parents in my life and while my dad has always been supportive, my mom still was emotionally abusive. Compared to my sister I would say I’m lucky to grow up the way I did. Although I have experienced a lot of traumatic things myself and had to endure life growing up with medical conditions I think that my childhood growing up has been relatively better than my sisters. Anyways, what I don’t understand is how she (meaning my sister) lives. My sister has a reason to be depressed and I really don’t yet here I am depressed. And I feel bad because whenever she reaches out to me and I tell her what’s going on and she is so nice to me and encourages me to think positively yet I still find myself feeling worthless and like I’m just trapped in this horrible life and way of thinking. I don’t see a point in living and I really think everyone would just be better off without me yet why do I feel this way?"

Volunteered as a scribe and fell in love with the ER. The people, the pace, the environment just really clicked for me. I did what every Emergency Medicine-bound med student in the US is supposed to do. I did some away rotations, got my letters. Maybe I should have applied more broadly to more residency programs in retrospect but I applied to a substantial number of programs. My application, by all accounts, was fine. I went to a reputable state MD school, did OK on board exams with solid scores and no failures, and supposedly my letters of rec (called SLOEs in the EM world) were good. Went on enough interviews that according to official data my chances of not matching were less than 3%. Made my rank list Come March 2019, and I found out I was part of that 3%. I didn't match. I was devastated. I have been ever since. I was lucky in that I was able to scramble into a 1-year prelim program. I'm currently reapplying to Emergency Medicine this cycle. On track to have the same overall number of interviews this year. Was I just a shitty interviewee last year? Did I interview better this year? Was there some hidden red flag on my application? Who the fuck knows. The only certainty in this hellish game is that I'll find out if I match on March 16, 2020, but statistically, reapplicants to the [Match](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Resident_Matching_Program) fare worse than fresh grads.

So if I fail to match again, then what? If you don't get a residency in x specialty (one year preliminary programs like the one I'm currently in don't count) you can't work as a full attending physician in that specialty. Specifically, if you don't do an Emergency Medicine residency no one will hire you to work in a tier-one city ER. Maybe I might fare better in the Match if I also applied to different, less competitive specialties like Family Medicine or Internal Medicine, but I pretty much dislike everything else in medicine and to be specific, I hate everything to do with primary care (Family Medicine) and working as an inpatient hospitalist or subspecialist (Internal Medicine). If you fail to match you get the option of immediately trying to scramble (called the SOAP process) into an open position, but guess what specialties most of those unfilled openings are in? Yep, IM and FM. And usually these unfilled spots are at shitty programs (there's a reason why they didn't fill, after all.) It's just doubly depressing and I'm fairly sure I would off myself if I had to work as an IM or FM doctor for the rest of my shitty miserable life.

I've never had a history of mental illness but the uncertainty of my future and the thought of not matching again just depresses me horribly. The more I ruminate about it the more I want to kill myself, and I certainly have the means to thanks to my 9mm handgun. As part of my current prelim year I have to do rotations in fields that have very little to do with Emergency Medicine (like my current inpatient hospitalist rotation) and to have to go to work for that every day is an internal torture for me. I've always been very good at compartmentalizing my emotions and feelings so thankfully no one at work has any idea of how I feel. Pretty sure they would force me to be hospitalized if anyone found out (which obviously would not be good for my future residency prospects). But I'm convinced that if I fail to match again on March 16, 2020 (when the results for the 2020 match come out), I will just kill myself. For one, anyone who has failed to match twice is going to be damaged goods and there's little chance you'll be competitive for \*any\* residency if you try to match again the next year. There just won't be anything worth living for anymore. Having a medical degree without residency is near useless and to enter just about any decent field outside of medicine would require starting from scratch with a huge pay cut too. My medical career was going so well, only for most of it to be suddenly destroyed in March 2019. We will find out if whatever remains can be salvaged on March 16, 2020 at 11 AM EST, and if I get to continue on my journey to become an ER doctor.

If not...these remaining two months will be my last."

**The Boy Who Feels (Or, Instead of Being Productive, Here I Am)**
I wonder how deep the fault lies, heavy and comfortable and there. Contrary to my complaints, to my criticisms, the unfair sharpness of my judgements, I’ve always been an optimist. Or perhaps I was just arrogant. I still am.
It shows in my recklessness, my impulsiveness. In nights not spent studying and a wandering mind behind the wheel. It speaks of a carelessness that’s selfish and detached and unkind. A non-living thing, upon which life happens and nothing more.
Once, I believed it was simply how I operated. Half-dreaming—or perhaps half-dead— and stolen away by everything and anything that’s simply not *here*. In lieu of eyes, I saw fit to walk through life with my terrible, callow heart. Instead of ears, I feel out the rhythm and the noise, the rise and fall and there I decide. I write and I talk and I think and I answer based on the churning of something inside of me  I cannot clearly name. On the sense of anticipation, such as before a drop or a fall or something equally dire and dramatic, that stays my hand and says *wait*.
*Choose another.*
*What else?*
*Something more.*
*That’s not it.*
*Start over.*
And sometimes.
*There.*
I’ve always trusted it. For everything. Whether it’s deciding on which path to take or what letter to choose, I’ve always relied on this inner knowing that I am nevertheless not privileged to unravel. It might just be what kills me, in the end.
Because with it, I never know when to stop. When to start thinking and not just acting and following and feeling. By blinding myself so willingly, I doom myself to never knowing until long after my foot missed the landing and I fall and fall and fall.
It is arrogance of the highest kind. To trust so completely on the unknown and uncontrolled mechanisms of your own mind that you actually feel surprise when the answer it supplies turns out to be wrong.
And sometimes, sometimes I use it to pick at reality. *How far can I go before everything collapses? How deep can I twist the knife before my life is irreversibly, horribly destroyed?*
The origins of this strange fixation is long forgotten or simply not made known to me. I don’t know when the longing for the summery start of a hero’s adventure corroded into a morbid fascination for the bitter, winter ending of a villain cut down, left to die alone and forgotten and unforgiven.
I cannot help the way my soul quails at the thought of pain, of suffering. But deeper still, I think a large part of me simply knows that I deserve it.
It’s a conundrum, really. It’s difficult to chase that suffering when there’s so many variables at play. Far too many people who have made the poor choice of getting attached, of investing their time in something that’s always waiting to be destroyed. The trappings of family and friends and innocent hearts too quickly broken.
Perhaps if I had been born in a different context, I could have done it easily. Took the blade or stole the gun or locked the rooftop door behind me. It’s simple to imagine, simpler still to actually follow through. There would’ve been no regrets, I don’t think, but how could I know?
Everything would have lined up so easily. I was already born to kill myself; I just need the right incentive. And yet, time and time again, something holds me back. Such a terrible thing, conscience, how it keeps me caged and wanting. I’m a man on borrowed time, when is it going to run out?
Maybe I was never meant to survive my birth. The privilege certainly belongs to greater men and women than I—my brother and my sisters, for one. Perhaps they would have loved being alive. Loved it better, stronger, far less selfishly.
Angel. *Messenger of God.*
Mary Grace. *Beloved; to thank.*
Bryan. *Noble.*
Perhaps they would’ve cherished it, their names, and not grow to hate it—and the ones who gave it to me, just a little—like I have. Perhaps they would’ve been happy and sometimes I think that I’m simply the result of their frustration from never really having the chance to live. After having fought so hard to exist, mine seems like a bitter sigh mistakenly given form after they have finally given up; there’s enough spite, I believe, to justify it.
If they’re with me, I’d like to say that I admire their efforts to remain. The first few years of my life were naive yet blissfuly full of wonder and hope. Far too many for a single child, sometimes, but maybe I wasn’t. I just wish they experienced their lost childhood in a better way, for far longer, before I inevitably destroyed even that.
Light may filter down onto shadows but definition demands that only one of them exists in a single space at a time. Where there is light, there is no darkness; where there is darkness, there is no light. Similarly, though they may occupy me for a time, it’s obvious that their hold is not everlasting. I exist too.
I miss their presence. They could’ve been happy and by extension, maybe I could’ve taken a little of that happiness for myself. Stored it away, deep down, for when it needs to be there before possibility becomes *it is done*.
I do wish to be happy, though I’m slowly realising that it’s less about opportunity and more about capacity. Maybe it’s my fault, maybe it isn’t. But then I never really do anything about it so maybe it is, after all.
Our counsellor said that I should stop thinking about it. Would you believe that it actually works? Of course, it does sear a little deeper, a little more violently each time but it does remove its immediate presence. It makes me laugh a little to visualise it, the sheer ridiculousness of asking someone to close their eyes instead of teaching them to turn away from the cliff’s edge. Funnier still that I want to keep walking, the knowledge safely and sweetly tucked between my ribs. It won’t break my fall, but is it so bad to not want it to?"

This is gonna be crazy lengthy so please bear with me. I’m gonna try to label the sections in all caps so if anyone wants to skip around they can. Also I’m on mobile so I’m sorry for the formatting )-: 
INTRO: I (22f) attend a university in the US and am in a major where there’s only like 20 students in my “grade” (like freshman, sophomore, etc.) and we are all in the same classes together and have been for four years, so it’s hard to meet other people. We have all also had the same group of professors for four years. So we all are very familiar with each other. 
I’m a senior and it is my last semester, I graduate this May. The head of the department is very involved and is making sure that each of us individually are on the track to graduating. 
BACKGROUND: As a little background I have had severe anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember. I also have mild PTSD. I’m in a situation where my mom raised me by herself and was a great mom but also was incredibly verbally and emotionally abusive so I basically am terrified of confrontation, am a huge people pleaser, definitely do not do anything to stand out, and I follow directions and I do what I’m supposed to do (which is get decent grades, live independently and take care of my two pets, it just worked out that I work at a wonderful job that wants to take me on after I graduate, basically I’m just trying to be successful so my mom is proud of me). I have been seeing a therapist and psychiatrist actively and seeking treatment, but I have relapsed a handful of times. 
Throughout my college career, it never fails that at some point in the semester there is a week or two where I fall into a depression pit and get too anxious to leave home but I still complete my projects (my major is VERY project based) and have never missed a deadline. I have never failed a class before. During these times I have been quite open with specific professors because there is an attendance policy in place where you can have 3 unexcused absences and after that your grade is affected. I have spoken so far to 3 professors and they have all been super wonderful and empathetic and willing to work with me. 
For my senior project, I am as far along as everyone else and continue to produce work even though my mental health has been suffering recently. My studio professor got hired about a year ago give or take and we have never had him before as a professor so none of the seniors know him well. The senior studios are split up into two classrooms, so there are two professors but we are all working on our final projects. My professor is incredibly rude and snarky and has an attitude with everybody. He has called students incompetent and told one particular girl that she didn’t have the ability to become our profession. He yelled at another student in front of everyone before. His work load is insane and way more work than the other senior studio. Today they just turned in a deadline that we turned in two weeks ago. Not only does he want us to work on our senior project but he wants to throw all kinds of extra assignments in there when that’s not the point of the class. It’s to do our final thesis project. 
SITUATION: Recently I had missed a few weeks of school because I was going through intense shit with my mom, I was physically ill with the flu and then I got a sinus infection on top of that, but was keeping him updated. I got a note from an urgent care type place stating that I was ill with a flu like virus and I sent a picture of it to him in an email. I did not attend class the next day either because duh I have all the flu symptoms. I don’t think he counted that as excused because I didn’t get a note for that day, but I’m not going to pay $80 every day that I’m sick after they already prescribed me medicine and whatever just so I can get a note ???? 
So the following week goes by and I’m not getting any better and am getting more symptoms of a sinus infection. Great. Obviously I didn’t go to class. This is where I messed up because I should have gone to the doctor sooner to get an excuse I guess. 
I was emailing him and telling him that I wasn’t going to class and as we were just working on our projects for the upcoming deadline this literal entire time, I didn’t need to physically be there because I have the software I need for it on my laptop. So I am continuing to work on my project this whooole time. The deadline was that Friday and we were presenting in front of the class and a guest. I was still ill but sucked it up bc it was a presentation. I went to school early to print my project and my sweet boyfriend drove me because he knew I was having a hard time. So I didn’t bring my wallet. Big accident. I went to print my presentation at our printing lab(11 x 17 sheets) and after a freaking insane amount of time wasted because the front desk people weren’t there, I realized that they only take the school cash and my school ID was in my wallet at home. At this point class had already started and I was PANICKING. I could feel my face getting hot and my body shaking. I went outside to get some cool air but it did not help. I was having a panic attack and crying and hyperventilating. I called my boyfriend and said screw this come pick me up because I’m not going in empty handed to explain why I have no presentation while I’m full on sobbing in front of my peers and a guest. 
I did send him an email before I left and explained what happened. I was SO embarrassed. I profusely apologized, accepted a grade penalty, and explained my mental health issues because this had to do with that and I’ve been able to be open with professors of the same college before with no problem. He didn’t email me back ever, which I was like what the fuck because that was a serious email. 
So the next Monday I’m still feeling like shit so I go to the on campus doctor. I have a sinus infection, my ears are clogged so i can’t hear, snot is constantly falling from my nose, I’m constantly coughing. It’s gross. While I’m there I figure I will get a note to excuse last week. The doctor wrote that I was ill last week and the day that I came in, signed and dated it. I sent my professor this email to explain why I was so sick and again he didn’t answer me. 
Fast forward to a few days later and my antibiotics aren’t working. The doctor had prescribed me amoxicillin but I do better with augmentin. I should have mentioned that to him but it didn’t occur to me. I emailed him this note bc it was on the day of class and said my antibiotics are not working this is why I’m not in class. He did not respond for a third time and stated that I would be attending class that Friday. At this point I’m freaking out. He’s purposely ignoring me and I was still incredibly embarrassed and shameful about my panic attack at school so this was just making it worse. 
That Friday I did not go. I know I told him I would. But I can honestly say that I didn’t go because of how fucking anxious I was to see his reaction to me. 
I was a wreck the whole weekend. I cried so hard, had several panic attacks and it was overall not a fun time. My poor boyfriend was doing his best to try to comfort me. He is the only person I talk to other than my therapist. I don’t have any other friends because nobody in my major likes me because of the fact that I miss class a lot and am generally really quiet. My mom has told me its my fault they don’t like me. 
He actually ended up cancelling class on that Monday which was a relief for me! So I went on Wednesday. I talked to my therapist that morning and we had planned that I would go in at the start of class and bring him my notes and tell him I wanted to show him my project. I went to go pull out my laptop and pulled up my project to discuss it with him. He came up to me and asked me if these notes were the ones I emailed him. I said yes, I brought them because you never responded to me and I wanted to make sure you got them. He said with an attitude “well you have a lot of unexcused absences”. I started to say something but I only got out “I can-“ at which point he cut me off and said (while there were other students around bc we were at my desk) “I don’t know what you’re going to do but you’re not going to pass”, and this part is fuzzy because I was already blindsided at this point, but he said something to the effect of “and fix whatever else is going on” which I took personally as a jab at my mental health. and then walked away from me and proceeded to call another student up to him to discuss their project. 
I sat there in disbelief. What the fuck. Right? What the fuck? If I don’t pass this class I will not graduate. If I don’t graduate I lose my job. My family will be SO disappointed, especially my mother who is taking on debt for me to attend college. I sat there for a few minutes and tried to work. I could feel myself getting worked up and I could feel the panic coming. My eyes started watering and I had to get the fuck out of there.  I went outside and didn’t know what to do. I couldn’t call my boyfriend because I knew he was in an exam at the time. I tried calling my therapist but she didn’t answer which I totally understand because she’s super busy but I thought I would try anyways. 
I took a walk around campus to try to calm down but I eventually ended up behind some dumpsters sobbing and hyperventilating. I called my dad who I have a great relationship with now (not so much when I was younger) and he was really supportive, he talked to me until my boyfriend got out of his exam and could drive me home. 
I’m at a loss. I attended work the next day and broke down there. They sent me home. I spent the whole day hating myself and sobbing. I have one friend in my major who I consider a very close friend if not my best friend even if I’m not hers. We have been friends for 3 years and she knows almost every detail of my life. I told her about this and she said I needed to meet with the head of our major. She helped me organize my thoughts and write out an email and I sent it last night. 
Now it’s today and I woke up crying, I genuinely had for the first time suicidal thoughts. My head was pounding and I couldn’t stop obsessing over this. My therapist called me and talked with me for 10 minutes which I appreciate more than she will ever know. She literally talked me off the ledge, she called me while I was sobbing. 
Fast forward and I grew some balls and went to studio. I went straight to my desk and my friend who sits across from me completely ignored me. She didn’t look at me or anything even when I spoke to her directly (which was really only a little conversation but she avoided eye contact) So I just worked on my stuff the whole studio, which is 4 hours long. I wanted to just work on my project but something unexpected happened and my professor assigned an assignment that was due at the end of class, something that he never does. I think he did this bc he thought I wouldn’t be there today. He avoided looking at me the entire class and when he went around to everyone’s desks he went to mine last. Our assignment was to hand draw 5 separate detailed items of our project. He told us a specific example to use, which coincidentally I was already thinking of doing, so I drew it. He came over to me and told me he didn’t get why I put it there and what it has to do with anything. Then he went to the girl next to me and she was like “I don’t know what to draw” and he told her she could draw what I just fucking drew. At the end of class he went around again and spoke to everyone again once except me. 
And now here I am. I really don’t know what to do. I hate myself because I know this situation is my fault and I should have just gone to class. If you made it this far I really really appreciate it. I needed to get this out."

This might sound pathetic but I literally have no friends/family/anybody I know that lives in the area that I'm currently living in. My problem starts where the it says ""my issue"". But honestly to get the full picture of how tragic my life feels right now read the background.
Some background...
I'm in my late twenties and grew up I  a military family so I have never lived long in on location.  At the age of 18 I left for the military myself but that's when my life changed for the worse. I was abused by my sqaud members almost daily. The abuse started as general new guy hazing stuff like making my run around looking for imaginary things or orders  etc. But things started to ramp up quickly being that I was the smallest and the youngest. It started with very hurtful verbal abuse (calling me racist names, calling me worthless/a retard for asking questions etc) from people my own rank all the way up to the my warrant officer. Soon verbal turn physical and yes sexual. I wasn't raped but I will not relive those memories for this post neither. Things carried on like that for what seemed like an eternity, i pretty much was forced out only 2 years into my dream of a long military career after 3 failed suicide attempts and an alcohol incident.
When I first came back I had a horrible time readjusting back to my former life. I was literally 100 pounds over weight (and the weight that I was when I entered boot camp at). I was back living with my parents which felt embarrassing and and overkill already to my already low sense of worth. I tried so reach out to everyone that I could to try to hang out with or talk but thi is always felt awkward  or in some cases I would be thirstier than a dying guy baking in the desert for months and immediately ruin the conversation and any chance of friendship.  I was so desperate for a normal sense of a relationship I fell quickly into a very toxic relationship ( I was a major contributor to the toxicity along with her some of her actions) 2 years later she ended up leaving me and i don't blame her one bit. I was extremely clingy and jealous. Since I was not treating any of my symptoms of depression and anxiety I would have days where I would literally sleep all day even at her place.... which was another thing....
When I first came back I had a horrible habit of never sleeping at night because again I was not treating my PTSD  or sleeping for days like a bear in hibernation. So when I was dating her I was always at her place. On my fridays I would pack some things in a backpack and no joke as if I was a kid going to sleep over his friend's house on the weekends. I would go to her place and sleep over then go back to my parents place as I worked and continue the cycle. I would have mental breakdowns at home too. I would have night terrors and periods where I would cut/burn myself leaving a couple of horrible scars on my chest/shoulder and forehead. 
Anyways things got a little better after I went on an absolute social purge and deleted my facebook and stopped replying to the little people who texted me. I left that job and actually started to address my severe depression and anxiety along with my weight issue as well. I went to the doctors and college. I tried to amend my very damaged relationship I had with my parents and sister. I sought the right treatment which lead me to a 6 year recovery period where I lost  60 pounds and try to practice healthy habits. I quit drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes. I now wake up to ride my stationary bike for 2-3 hours a day or go for very long walks. I currently work full time at a job that I actually enjoy. I even have my own unit in a apartment building but the only hang up is that I have an extremely hard time meeting new people or even talking to people
It feels like I have all these skills to maintain myself so I avoid those cycles of depression and suicidal thoughts but gained no social skills at all. I freeze up and all those self defeating and self doubtfulness/loathing thoughts come washing over my like a tsunami. Therefore I tend to avoid crowds and gatherings.
_____________________________________________________
The issue:
 My problem is that I feel like a stranger in a town I literally spent the most amount of my life in.  I have no friends at all and the loneliness has been fueling my recent growing depression. I feel as if years of work is slowly unraveling itself. I've tried apps (pof tinder etc) and what not but honestly I was quickly discouraged when I literally had no replies other than bots and escorts. I'm left a sense of hopelessness even at someone somewhat young. I feel like my twenties has been a waste and trying to be the lone wolf in life is turning out to be something I don't want. I just want to find genuine people to hang out with and talk to. I have no idea where to start. I could really use some help rebuilding a social life and honestly find someone special... 
Again sorry if the post is too long or whatever I just really needed to vent. Maybe my expectations are too much for myself and I should be satisfied with just being here at the present moment but the loneliness really is starting to a sink hole that I'm finding it to be harder and harder to climb out of...
TL;DR-  Military veteran with PTSD/Major Depression/Anxiety and absolutely no social skills in desperate need of help in relationship building."

That's not my business.
I don't want to rule or conquer anyone.
I should like to help everyone if possible.
Jew - Gentile - Black Man, White.
We all want to help one another, human beings are like that.
We want to live by each other's happiness.
Not by each other's misery.
We don't want to hate and despise one another.
And this world has room for everyone, and the good Earth is rich can provide for everyone.
The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way.
Greed has posioned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed.
We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in.
Machinery that gives us abundance has left us in want.
Our knowledge has made us cynincal.
Our cleverness, hard and unkind.
We think too much, and feel too little.
More than machinery, we need humanity.
More that cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness.
Without these qualities life will be violent, and all will be lost.
The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together.
The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men - cries out for universal brotherhood - for the unity of us all.
Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world - millions of despairing men, women, and little children - victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people.
To those who can hear me, I say - do not despair.
The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed - the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress.
The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people.
And so long as men die, liberty will never perish. ...
Soldiers!
Don't give yourselves to brutes - men who despise you - enslave you - who regiment your lives - tell you what to do - what to think and what to feel!
Who drill you - diet you - treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder.
Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men - machine men with machine minds and machine hearts!
You are not machines!
You are not cattle!
You are men!
You have the love of humanity in your hearts!
You don't hate!
Only the unloved hate - the unloved and the unnatural!
Don't fight for slavery!
Fight for liberty!
In the 17th Chapter of St Luke it is written: ""the Kingdom of God is within man"" - not one man nor a group of men, but in all men!
In you!
You, the people have the power - the power to create machines.
The power to create happiness!
You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure.
Then - in the name of democracy - let us use that power - let us all unite.
Let us fight for a new world - a decent world that will give men a chance to work - that will give youth a future and old age a security.
By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power.
But they lie!
They do not fulfil that promise.
They never will!
Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people!
Now let us fight to fulfil that promise!
Let us fight to free the world - to do away with national barriers - to do away with greed, with hate and intolerance.
Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all men's happiness.
In the name of democracy, let us all unite"

I take the highest dose for these 10 years as well, making me even more at risk.
I already experience extents of all of these things sometimes, so I highly expect to be affected if, or more likely when (due to most likely inevitable loss of health insurance) I discontinue my meds, a slow taper is said to NOT prevent the risks.
I’m 24, live with my parents, failed my driving test (never been very comfortable with driving, but not driving has been life crippling), been extremely socially isolated for years, have no friends (not even online anymore, it just felt pointless continuing to talk to people I’d never see in real life), never had a girlfriend and I’m a goddamn virgin who’s never even kissed.
A girl on Whisper just roasted me for implying we should hookup before we die from the CoronaVirus, I didn’t have the balls to follow through anyway, I can’t leave the house with being questioned, even if my parents aren’t home, the cameras send notifications to all of our phones. Explaining this kind of thing would be VERY UNCOMFORTABLE.
I told the girl I was not a player, and it was important to me that she enjoyed it. She told me I was worse than the perverts who message her, because I didn’t even offer to buy her dinner.
She ten accused me of being unable to get pussy and living in my mom’s basement, which (apart from the basement part, to be technical) is pretty spot on.
I then opened up with honesty about my depression and told her I’m sorry and I’ll leave her alone. She didn’t respond again.
Yes, I’m 24 and still at home, and securing a basic job bagging groceries like a teenager’s first job has been a huge accomplishment for me. And I just started community college spring 2020. Being 24, my financial aid is plentiful and safe, because it requires MY OWN financial information and NOT MY PATIENTS (one of my classmates recently got dropped out due to losing financial aid, good Ol America).
Socially, the only way it’s better than grade school is I’m not bullied. But nobody really talks to me either, and I feel more cut off from humanity than exes, despite being surrounded by people everyday (school and work).
Due to my living situation (can’t drive, live with parents, have such a bottom level job) I’m way too insecure to even try and make friends, I know people will judge me. Asking out women? Forget about that completely.
I am not, never have been, and never will be, an extrovert.
I already know I’m widely considered unattractive, but I don’t think that is the true biggest barrier, I think it is to do with my social skills and insecurity. 
I’m being expected to be more and more independent and responsible at my age, and in less than a couple of years, legally kicked off of my parents health insurance, and it’s highly unlikely the job I have now will provide that even by then.... 
And to know that the chemicals/neurotransmitters in my brain have been, and/or will be altered so greatly that I will be incapable of basic human feelings and functionings, not even being a human being anymore, is the most terrifying thing I’ve ever faced in my life. There is no cure, or treatment? for PSSD and the other Post SSRI long-term/life-long side effects.
Doctors do not take PSSD/long-term/permanent SSRI side effects seriously, and even if they did, they would be unable to do anything about it.
My doctor has been to trigger happy in raising dosages just for me having any amount of depression, anxiety, anger, etc. left. 
I was put on Oxcarbazepine 600 MG twice a day and Sertraline 200 MG a day 10 years ago for life crippling OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder). And more recently, Bupropion SR 100 MG a day to get my rage outbursts under control, as I was becoming a danger to myself and others, and at serious risk of ending up getting arrested with how explosive my rage was.
My doctor asked me if I still had any depression, anger, anxiety, etc. A couple of months later, and immediately upon saying yes, doubled my Bupropion SR to 200 MG a day. About a week later, he told me I could cut back to 100 MG, as I was suffering from worsened anxiety, and worse sexual dysfunction (which I didn’t mention).
I only care about my sexual functioning because I was holding hope, that id get to use it, one day, hopefully while still in my 20s.....
Ironically, I wished away my sexuality and even my emotions just days before the doubled dose seemed to grant my wish, causing me serious regret.
I seem to have returned to baseline of before the Bupropion SR was doubled, but my ejaculate volume is still much lower (before I cummed A LOT).
After the effects of double Bupropion SR I found out about PSSD from Googling my symptoms, and I fell down the rabbit hole. I’ve been worried about this 24/7 ever since. So about a month now....
I’m still worried about the inevitable likely forced cutoff of my medication, permanently (or even if it’s just for a few years, still serious) disabling me (it can even go beyond sexual functioning) and being uninsured will only hurt even more as a vegetable. I also have to worry about becoming severely disabled from OCD returning full-blown.
If I want to pay so I can lose my virginity, even that has a time limit if losing my meds means losing my libido, and/or at the least even less pleasurable orgasms...
This SSRI BULLSHIT just reinforces my feelings of being sexually worthless, and just not being a human being."

Me and my sister were raised in a chaotic household, without the money needed to take care of two children. My dad in particular could become extremely angry over anything. He was and still is an alcoholic, and spend tremendous amounts of money on cigarettes and booze instead of feeding us. I often found myself hiding behind curtains and other places, eating one-dollar baguettes or anything i could find. He and his parents ""my grandparents"" where quick to defend him at any cost.
Constant warfare between the two sides of my family made me chose sides, and who to align myself with in the next shitstorm of family drama. I was and still am extremely loyal, and will do anything someone tells me just to avoid trouble. 
As i said my mom and my dad didn't get along and often fought over who should have have us the most, and this often resulted in things becoming very heated, my dad would often chase me  on the way home to my mom, just because he was bitter over the fact that i went to my mom more than him. I know he did track where i walked because we often conveniently ""meet"" me in ally ways, and different places of the town where he never drove or would have any reason to drive to, hi used this ""convenience to drive me back to his place without my say"". 
one time he and my grandparents almost rammed my sister and my mom off the road, in an argument over a party she had been to or something, when they lost them they went back home where i was gaming minecraft and started to whale on me instead, saying that i was on their side and we where disgusting people and so forth..... honestly i don't remember much as it was this episode that left me with possible PTSD, as one doctor has said to me, but its not confirmed so.... I often prayed to god to kill me at the age of eight, as i was mentally exhausted. 
The police became involved several times, but nothing came of it as my dad is a master manipulator and always manages to get out of those situations, like this one time where he flirted with one of the inspectors of child protective services.   
Bulling is also something that has stuck with me, the humiliation of public bulling in school is the one of the worst things i have ever experienced. I can take a beating, and having been kicked by my class mates to unconsciousness, i can say that humiliation is worse. Standing in-front of the class and having people laugh at you, leaves a sense of shame that you cant get rid off. 
I moved from home about half year ago and started my higher education, but all of my experiences has left me a anxious wreck, if for example someone touches me without me knowing, something like a pat on the back or a loud noise. Will trigger many kinds of reactions a out fear, and if i become stressed out i often get a panic attack. 
this just starches the surface of what i have experienced, with abusive relationships and more, hopefully you guys can relate, i haven't really had many friends at all so haven't been able to compare my childhood wit anyone else, wonder if i am over reacting or not.

And I honestly don’t think it is catastrophizing. If anything events are worse than I anticipated.
Basically, it feels like I have been consigned to a joyless life for an indefinite period of time, with serious moral consequences if I go against it, and I don’t know what to do. (I do not have a plan or anything, but I have more than once had the morbid thought that I can’t commit suicide because a dead body is a public health risk.) I was already short on reasons to think the future will be brighter; now I cannot see any at all."

I cannot be in silence. So I am listening to 90’s country instead of the usual current day rock.  
And for about thirty minutes. I was happier than i have been in a year. For thirty glorious, heavenly minutes. I had no anxiety. No depression. No stress. Just belted out some country and laughed as my puppers side eyed my singing. True peace.  
Once the dishes were done. The kitchen cleaned up from dinner two nights ago. And the dishwasher running. Once I returned to the couch. The happiness left. As always it does.  
But for those thirty glorious minutes. I was free.

I strongly disagree. In silence there is so much noise. Such a cacophony of noise.  
“You are trash”.  
 “No one loves you”.  
  “You are a waste of air”.

No. It is my own voice I hear. When the music stops. The tv turns off. I only ever hear my voice. My daemons. My silence.

I’ve been separated from my wife for the past two month, we have been together for 14 years. (Married for 3). We have 2 amazing children together.
I admit I haven’t been the best husband or dad. I’ve taken them all for granted. I should have realised that I was being an arsehole a lot sooner. I spent too much time working rather than spending time with my beautiful family. Used to come in late from work and just fall asleep and not have time for anyone. My wife and I used to argue about loads of different things, like money and bills. I was a shit person, I made her feel shit unintentionally. I love her with the whole of my heart.
When we separated I had so much time to think about all the shit stuff that I had done. So I made loads of changes, spent less time in the office, started collecting kids from school, taking the kids out for dinner. I’ve lots loads of weight, because I’m working out, I’m paying for PT sessions. I genuinely believe I have changed my whole lifestyle to be a better person. 
Unfortunately this wasn’t enough for her. She doesn’t want me back. She said it’s a little too late. This is killing me so much. All I want is to hug her again. She is the love of my life. I miss her so much! I just want to be able to treat her like she should be treated. I’ve realised now what i should have been doing. She’s not having any of it. 
Now I have major regret. I’m in a dark place. I feel worthless. I’ve been to the doctor, they said that I have severe depression. It’s a big dark hole that I feel like I cannot get out of. I can’t function properly day to day. She told me to tell the kids it’s all my fault, she said the kids are not bothered wether I’m not there, they don’t ask for me etc. 
The kids are the only positive thing I have let in my life.
I don’t know what to do anymore. Will it ever get better? I feel like I don’t need to be around anymore. 
I feel like there’s nothing left for me now. Constant memories are making me feel shit all day everyday. I think that now she might be seeing someone else. So that means there would be no way for me to go back to the only love of my life.

It’s long, but it would mean the world to me if someone could read it. : I’m just a 20 year old girl, with an amazing family. I have 2 parents who have given me the world, and I am the oldest sibling of 4. I have had a great education all of my life, I went to an awesome university in my town but I had to take a gap year due to my mental health issues. I live on the East Coast, and I have all of the opportunities in the world to live the life I dream of living. I have a therapist, a beautiful house, an absolutely amazing boyfriend, and some close friends. Nowadays though, the life I dream of living consists of these few things: Energy, excitement about my days, and a positive outlook. At this rate, switching my major, finishing college, and moving along in life feels impossible. 
I took a gap year because the lifelong anxiety I had was starting to take a toll. Originally I had just planned to take a semester off because I wanted to go to therapy and then get back to school. I didn’t want to be out for too long because I thought I wouldn’t want to go back. But that was in September. It’s now March, and after having mono for a few months, not being in school, struggling with anxiety, feeling lonely partially because I am not in school and I’m watching all of my peers live the life I had planned for myself, coupled with mental illness, I have developed depression. At first my psychologist didn’t think I was depressed, because the symptoms of mono coincide with depression. Also, some people have a depressive episode when their anxiety is very bad, which mine was. Luckily it’s a bit better now. But the depression has taken the front row seat now, so that rains on my parade pretty badly. I also talked about the fear of becoming depressed a lot, too. But now fast forward, I most certainly have depression. We are aware of this now. 
What I don’t understand about depression, and never did until I was diagnosed, is the feeling of being hopeless and having nothing to live for, like many depressed people talk about. I used to think, “how could you feel hopeless? There are so many beautiful things in this world. There are so many beautiful places, faces, moments, things to look back on and things to look forward to. You have so many talents and so many amazing qualities, and you make people so happy without even realizing it”. But now, I understand. 
I truly understood the hopeless feeling when I started realizing the amounts of mental and physical energy it took for me to perform mental tasks... to even *want* to do them, and have a reason for them. My body feels like a rock that I am lugging around. I feel like I don’t even have the capacity to think like I used to, yet somehow I still have all of the energy to overthink. But my creativity is stifled, I don’t see the world as colorfully as I used to, and it feels like even on the nicest of days the world is still the gray winter we’ve had here for so long. I just **don’t have the energy** for almost anything. And sometimes I will get myself going, but I don’t feel as if I am doing my tasks or feeling things the way I used to. I don’t feel full of life and wonder anymore. Small moments don’t bring me a boatload of joy. I used to pride myself in finding happiness and joy in the little things, but now my surroundings feel dull and it’s always like I’m searching for something bigger. Which I know isn’t the issue here. It’s just my brain. I drove to Philly with a friend about 3 weeks ago on a Saturday just for fun, and I thought the new environment would make all the difference, but it just didn’t. I was definitely filled with more enthusiasm than I usually was, but I could only keep that energy for so long. And once again, I didn’t feel how I used to feel before all of this hit. So, back to my original point. I feel hopeless. Because how am I supposed to get anywhere with this lack of motivation and energy? 
I simply just don’t have the energy or stamina to maintain the activities I need and want to do. I know what’s good for me, what *should* be good for me and making me happy. After all, it used to. But I am always tired in some way. I never feel well rested. I used to be active and energetic but now my body is telling me to lay down, even if it’s bad for my brain. I tell myself I should take care of myself the way a parent would take care of a child. That my body is worth taking care of. But **I am just so sick of FORCING myself to do things. And then not being able to create habits because of the amount of energy it takes. And then feeling totally hopeless.** 
I do not want to “accept” that I’m depressed. I don’t even like saying I’m depressed, and I hate it even more when people say it isn’t curable. How isn’t it curable? I didn’t have it my whole life. Maybe the signs were there subtly, but if I knew about them, I could’ve done something before I hit this barrier. 
My family has done everything for me and I love them so much. I really do. I absolutely love my parents. My mom is so creative, free spirited, stubborn, funny, and on the go. My dad is wise, determined, nurturing, hilarious, and level headed. My siblings all have minds of their own, too. My sister is adventurous and creative like me. My brothers are, well, my brothers. Haha. My grandma is an absolute saint. But a lot of the time, especially recently, it’s hard not to distance myself from my parents when I feel so down. I just feel like the disappointment who is always being watched because of my vulnerable mental state. Everything is always about what I’m not doing, and I know it’s because they care and think me doing things will help, but it’s just not that simple. I get irritable, and this causes tension. I kind of isolate myself from them. Not really, but I just don’t initiate conversation with them. I feel awkward. I’ll fix this but it’s just hard. 
Somehow — I hate admitting this because I never wanted to get to a place where I felt my significant other was one of the biggest sources of my happiness because it’s unhealthy — my boyfriend makes me feel more alive than most things anymore. It won’t be this way forever, but right now it is. Maybe God, or the universe, or whoever, placed him in my life for a reason. He is the most positive, energetic, happy, stress free, level headed, patient, caring, affectionate, hilarious, awesome person I know. This kid reassured me everyday, just because he **feels** like it, of how much he loves me, how I make him the happiest kid in the world, how I brighten his days, how I make him laugh like nobody else, and any other sweet thing you can think of. And to me, they aren’t cliches because I know he means them. He reassured me that he knows who I am outside of this depression. He loves me for me. And he constantly reminds me that he is here with me every step of the way, that he believes in me, and that he will not leave my side. It blows my mind. I don’t understand it, but man is it relieving. I cannot even explain how much I love him. He just **never** gets frustrated with me, and always prioritizes my happiness. He lives an insanely well balanced life, good for him. He has perfect mental health, and I envy it but I’m more so just grateful to have someone like that in my life. Honestly, he’s been a saving grace some days. 
I want to get back in school as soon as possible. I want to know how to build myself back up so that I can have a daily routine, and energy, and be excited. I don’t want to feel like my brain and body are stifled anymore. I want myself back. I struggle so much with feelings of “is this worth it?” Because is it? People would surely miss me, but what about *me*? How am I supposed to live if I feel like everything is a matter of me dragging myself out of a ditch? 
I wish that I could go back in time, and almost just watch my young self from afar. I was so happy go lucky. Spunky. Happy. I wish I could just hold my own hand, and see my smile and take it with me into the future. 
Sometimes I get really scared because I have thoughts about dying. I don’t want to die and I don’t want to commit suicide but what if I become that way to escape the pain? And I go nuts? And I lose my boyfriend and those who matter to me?

361,1.9931640625,0.306396484375,-1.966796875,0,2,"I lost a friend to suicide : Hey, friends. 
I wanted to share this in hopes that it helps just one person or puts things into perspective. 
Two weeks ago I found out my friend passed away. He took his own life. I worked with him for about a year and a half, he would go out for drinks with us every once in awhile, and him and I would go out by ourselves once a month or so. We weren’t super close, but we were good friends. When he quit, we stopped seeing each other as much. 
Three weeks before he died, I called him up and asked for a huge favor. He lived within a mile of me and I needed his help changing a flat tire and wanted him to show me how. He had plans that night but said they could wait and he’d be over within an hour. When he arrived, I asked how he was doing and he made a sarcastic comment about how everything sucks. I asked if everything was okay and he said “not really, but that’s life!” He helped me change the tire, I gave him a hug and told him we should get drinks soon. Him and I had leaned on each other in the past when we were struggling so I wanted to be there for him. 
I didn’t reach out soon enough. When I heard the news I was in shock. I was with a friend and went into their bathroom and literally fell to my knees and silently sobbed. When I drove home that night I cried. I took a different way home than normal and by coincidence passed the bar that him and I would go to. I had to pull over because I was crying so hard. I was sobbing and screaming “it would’ve been okay, I promise you. Everything would’ve been okay.” As if he could hear me. The next day, I had to leave work because I couldn’t stop crying. I took the day after that off. I couldn’t think about anything besides the fact that he was gone. Whenever I was outside I would think that everything just felt different. The world feels different and empty without him in it. 
You always think about how sad your parents will be, your best friends, your SO. He wasn’t my best friend, we saw each other once every 4 or 5 months. Even ex-coworkers who hadn’t seen him in a year are grieving massively. My coworkers and I arranged a dinner with his family and friends last weekend and I witnessed first hand the grief they were experiencing. 10 of us who worked with him showed up, one drove 5 hours to be there. The others opted out because they were still struggling so much (they will be attending the official memorial). My point is, death reaches so much further than you think it will. 
I’ve been there, and I know that when you’re feeling so low, you truly think the people in your life will be better off without you. I’ve also gotten past that and have made amazing progress in my mental health journey. I also recognize that everyone has different struggles and I’m not trying to downplay anything you might be going through. But experiencing the grief, and seeing the grief that the people closest to him were going through adds even more perspective to it for me. 
Anyways, this was way longer than I expected. Reach out to your friends and tell them you love them and are there for them, if you’re in a place mentally where you are able to do so. And feel free to reach out to me personally if you are struggling."

Over the last couple of years here anxiety has worsened and over the last few months it's just too much for me, we don't see anybody anymore, if we do she has a panic attack before it and i've ended up having to cancel plans. It's our nieces third birthday party tomorrow and we were supposed to be going to stay up at my parents for the weekend and she doesn't want go. Fair enough, but I have been seeing my family less and less because of her needing her weekends to herself.
She's not from here so has no family or friends here who aren't mine so she really feels like she has nobody else but I'm exhausted. I can ask her family and friends from back home to talk to her but she doesn't want me to tell anyone. She believes she is just in the way and makes everyone's life shit, I try and tell her it's not true but it's so deep rooted into her mind that she just think she'd be better off dead, she's threatened suicide before so I feel like if I leave her even for this weekend she would kill herself as it's not really a threat but just her mindset of thinking she's better off dead. Idk anymore, I really don't. I don't even know if this is just kme being an asshole i'm just lost and confused and tired. I still love her but she just doesn't care about life anymore.
She stopped taking medication about a year ago as she thought it was making it worse, I respected her wishes and tbh, sometimes it seemed fine but lately it's absolutely not fine and she refuses to go back on any form of medication. IDK please help, should I leave? I'm so worried about her but also worried about myself and just feel sick."

We were engaged to be wed after 2 years of a relationship, 4 months after engagement. She was very abusive physical and mental but She was the only thing ever on my mind. Idk why I ever let it go as far as it did. Maybe it was just love... or so I though it was. Day in and out..  long nights of work (railroad is a unforgiving career). She was the person I could open up to about anything, who I though was my best friend. We shared the good times, the bad, the sick and the sad together.  We were both introverts so we basically had each other then friends at work. We were not the big party type more of the party of 2 type so she was basically all I had, so you could say she was my best friend, as everyone who wants that bliss of a relationship. One night we were drinking together, having a great time playing games together and just having a great time when we started a serious conversation about our future...  this is where things go down hill and fast. We got to talking about what we would want and things we could see us doing in the future. I go on saying how I’d like to own a 1968 Dodge Charger and to be happily married and she went on too day she wanted to own a 70 Dodge Dart  and to finally have a successful marriage. We get to drinking some more and she lets it slip...  that she had cheated on me twice in the first 3 weeks of our relationship...  once with her ex husband and once again with a random hook up she had while in Vegas for some sort of convention she had for her current place of work. I stop dead in my tracks of doing anything... feeling my chest tighten up..  I was tired of how she would hit me or do horrible abusive things to me. I had got up and just walked out of the house and went to a friends house. Didn’t want to speak to KR or even see her... I mean for fucks sake if someone moves too fast in my general direction I flinch now I had no
Idea why would of happens if I had said something. I was raised to never lay a hand on a woman so I was defenseless...  I call off the next day of work and just call her and tell her I want all of her stuff out of the home I own. We get into a big argument, her saying oh it was so far in the past I should just forget about it. It’s done and over now why ruin something we have now.  “What a relationship built on lies?” I say to KR. I went through her fight for her kids, fight to keep her own stuff. Through thick and thin for that woman for her to say she cheated on me in the start...  after the big ending/fight we had she tells me I’m this and that and less of a man for leaving someone over something so little... yea. To her it was little...  But to the now..  I’m sitting here depressed as all hell. Drinking my sorrows and sadness away every night thinking to
My self, did I do the right thing...   still as it is 4 months later I ask my self should I of stayed with her...  I’m so lonely now and I don’t know what to do with my self on a daily basis. The tattoos and drinking only do so much for me..  lately it’s been getting through all the pain I put my self through. I feel just so alone and like I will never find anyone else. I want to look her up and tell her I’m sorry everyday but I can’t come to my senses to do it cause I know I’m not in the wrong here yet I feel sorry..  I don’t know what to do anymore beside drink my self to sleep every morning and maybe one of these dating sight will come through that I find the right one but it just does not feel like any of them actually work (beside matching with a damn bot).

I was thinking that everything is useless and has no meaning, and even that ""no-meaning means to give a meaning"" way of thinking couldn help at all. It was kind of a psychotic episode.

That is struggling through life. I have came to the conclusion that none of my dreams are going to come true, due to my mental health, social awkwardness, and now my age. I have recently quit a very good paying job that I didn’t hate. Gave/ thrown away most of my things. Then moved into an 8x12 garden shed out in the woods. I spend half of my day trying to figure out what is wrong with me. The other half wishing I had the grit to kill my self.
I grew up extremely isolated. My parents got divorced when I was 2. I grew up on a farm 5 miles from a small town. With my dad and older brother. My dad has some trust and paranoia issues. So other people were not welcome at our home. Our whole world was the three of us and the farm. When I was 13-14 my brother ran away. A few months later my dad moved out. After the state found out they placed me with my mom. She lived in an apartment in a city with my two half brothers. I acted out and spent the rest of my teenage years in and out of juvenile placements. As a young adult I used/sold/made drugs. In and out of jail finally spending my early and mid twenties in prison. Since then I have a few legal issues but not to big of a deal.
My dream has always been to find a wife to make a home/family with. As time has gone on I have changed  it has changed a little the past few years I’ve been looking for a woman with children. I would really like to be involved raising kids I’m very intelligent and have countless skills. That I would like to be able to pass on.
Over the years I have dated a few women. Also had two long term relationships. One was woman was very violent and controlling. The other person was a thief, dishonest, unfaithful and no help with anything. She didn’t have a job for all 5 years. She left me a year ago for a man that beats her, has no car no job and lives at his brothers house. She gave her kids to her mom to raise.
I have no problem getting or keeping a job, I have been in a financial position to buy a home a few times,but never have. I’m miserable in an empty house. It feels like jail/prison sometimes worse.
In the last year I have dated 4 women, three of them stole from me. The other one didn’t want to see me again cause I wouldn’t have sex with her.
I give up, the harder I try the worse it gets. Why can’t I just blast this hottie and be done? Obviously I’m not capable of achieving my dreams. I can’t get the thought out of my head of what it would do to my parents. I can’t wait for them to die, so I can."

But I feel I have bipolar mainly because I can be really happy but at times like now I just feel like what's the point of me in the world. I don't know what to do and want to get help

When you are a 22 year old male kissless virgin people are just disgusted by you, they'll think you're an incel. 
People don't take you seriously, they can't comprehend the immense pain male virgins like me have to go through everyday. If they knew, they would have more respect for people like me.
But instead all people can do is mock male virgins, society doesn't listen to male virgins their problems and their feelings. All they do is make us feel more insecure and inferior. 
Society just wants male virgins like me to die a painful death, dying of a heart attack because of the constant emotional pain."

Everything is just so numb I don't even know why I bother anymore. Everything I used to love is has just turned into a tedious task and I feel like nothing I do is ever right. I have practically zero friends. I rarely leave my house anymore unless it's to go to work. I wrote a suicide note the other day. Am I ever gonna need it? Probably not. I had a friend commit suicide last year and I remember how much is broke me. I'm only 22. I truthfully thought I'd never make it this far and I dont know what to do. This is not how I imagined how my life would turn out when I was a kid. Why does nobody even care about me? Why am I like this? Why does nobody fucking love me?"
388,-0.003826141357421875,1.3974609375,-1.5625,1,1,"Life is just very bland, to an uncomfortable, empty degree : So, for some back context I am 22, male, I live with my girlfriend, 18, and I left home to move across the country for work (New Zealand, moved from Wellington to Tauranga, basically 400km away from where I grew up, all my family and friends).
Things have been up and down, but despite days where things are good, things also feel highly negative anyway. For example, today I spent 5 hours cleaning my car by hand, polishing, waxing, etc and it felt good to clean it up. As most of you may know, when you get into a slump your environments tend to fall down into a mess with you. So it felt good to tidy it up finally. Despite that, I don't feel accomplished, I don't feel happy, partly stems from finding out my girlfriend had been lying to me for 6 months about her smoking habit, and despite switching to a vape to restart quitting for real this time I still feel extremely stuck on that. Not hate, just another thing contributing to this overall bland feeling that things are just happening around me in life and I'm not really involved in it.
I have good hours at work, my boss is amazingly understanding, I have a family wedding approaching in 3 weeks. Yet all of it I feel increasingly detached from.
It's hard to describe, I don't feel like crying, I don't feel like suicide, I don't feel like self harm, I just feel empty, unattached to anything going on, it doesn't matter if I act in situations because bad things occur anyway like I don't exist in my friendships and relationship, so I feel like if I just stop existing nothing would alter, nobody would be affected, like I was never there in the first place.
I have good days, nothing goes wrong at all, but still I don't feel happy I don't feel good it's just a day where nothing overly bad happened so it's classified as good.
I've lost all motivation to show up to my job, I do the bare minimum to pay my rent and bills then I call sick and I'm ashamed of it, I hate being at home but if I show up to work all that happens is I get a panic attack, crawl into the bathroom and have a breakdown for half an hour and everyone questions it.
I can't even bother to take myself out anywhere, unless it's important I shut any idea I have down and just sit in bed.
All of it just gets hit with ""what's the point ill just be using my time being sad and moody elsewhere so why bother going out""
Just needed a rant really, all my friends I had here in town were workmates who have now quit for university and moved away, the new hires don't speak English and are older, my girlfriend is here but she has her own issues and unloading all my unhappiness on her will just make more issues than it'll help because nobody can fix me, except myself and my own motivation to get out of this rut.
I just wish I had a circle to come drag me out of the house, or people on discord to game with, literally any form of contact to fill my time in with and rediscover love for doing things.
Hopefully things pick up soon"
