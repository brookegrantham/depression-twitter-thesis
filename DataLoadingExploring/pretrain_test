&amp;#x200B;

She keeps saying that she's a burden on me and that I shouldn't even be with her, she's tried to harm herself multiple times, and I was there to stop her.

&amp;#x200B;

Please tell me if there's anything I can do to make her life better, I feel like what I do is never enough and I am willing to do anything...

we've been together for a year now..."
1,"

Whenever I look in the mirror I just see a shadow of the person I used to be. I used to love sports, have friends, be social, but now its a challenge to get out of bed.

How do you even start to feel normal again when everything inside of you just feels wrong."
2,"After 10 years of feeling miserable, and struggling to overcome and move on from all the failure in my life, I eventually got to the point where, objectively speaking, my life was in a good spot.

At 29 I finally graduated from the degree I'd started at 18, I somehow got lucky enough to land a really good job. I'd started exercising more and going to the gym. I'd always struggled with feelings of extreme loneliness, but now I was dating a girl who obviously loved me.

Throughout my 20s I thought if I pushed hard enough and persevered, I could eventually be happy.

But good old me, I'm still miserable. The success I've finally found doesn't make me feel anything. I still feel like an empty shell. My brain just doesn't register any positive emotions, only negative ones. I have zero motivation to live when there is no emotional reward for good experiences.

 I broke up with the girl I was dating, because even though I cared about her, and on some level I knew it was good to have someone in my life who cared about me, I seemed unable to experience feelings of being in love. It was eating me up inside knowing that I couldn't reciprocate the love she felt for me. 

I feel cheated for having spent so much time trying to turn my life around, only for it to have made no difference. I'm so tired. I'm tired of therapy and trying to get help. Tired of having to push myself to keep existing, when all I get in return is feeling sad and lonely. I'm tired of suddenly finding myself a few years older and realising I have no new happy memories. It's all a waste of time."
3,"That cycle when you stay up late at night because it feels peaceful and free of responsibility, but then you stay up late too many days in a row and now you’re waking up way too late in the day and your productivity is low and you’re not happy with your performance/attendance at work but knowing that doesn’t motivate you to fix your sleep schedule, it just keeps you feeling like shit about yourself….who can relate?"
4,"I’ve notice for last year or so, whenever I have a depressive episode it starts off with me being sad low and hopeless, then becomes rage and hatred, I had anger issues as a child ( mainly because of abuse) but when I first started to have depression ( about 4 years ago) I was a lot more quiet and content, and whenever I had a depressive episode it was just sadness and hopelessness but I rarely ever got angry but now, every depressive episode is met with so much rage and hatred, to the point where I literally wanna murder someone or I wish that everyone would die, idk wtf is going on"
5,"I visited with a friend for a few hours, it was fine, nothing bad happened, we chatted and ate lunch at a restaurant. When I got home I was met with this horrible wave of sadness and hopelessness, I just want to curl into a ball and disappear. There was nothing stressful or difficult about this visit but my brain is acting like something horrible happened. What the heck is wrong with me? I'm trying to get my social life back on track after covid, but this keeps happening."

I’m a shell, I don’t remember the last time I was happy, I don’t remember the last time I was excited for anything, I don’t remember feeling sadness or anger; though I must’ve felt them at some point because I know what they are. 

Most times I feel absolutely nothing, and the times when I do feel something it’s pure self hatred, misery and dread all mixed together in some unholy cocktail of despair. Those times I usually just blast music or go to sleep. Most days I just go through the motions, walk the streets among people, yet feel completely isolated, I can count on one hand the amount of interactions I’ve had with people this month.

The only thing that brings me any kind of solice is music, I’m always listening to it, and when I’m not I’m playing guitar, which I play atleast 6hours a day, started at 13, thought if I won’t be happy I might aswell be great; and maybe that will bring me happiness. Hasn’t worked, though I’m good, I just hate talking to people too much, hate vapid social media too much to market myself or join a band.

And that’s the thing, I despise talking to people, simply buying food fills me with an absolute sensation of imminent doom, it feels like it physically revolts me, contorts what little of a soul I have. No friends, never a girlfriend, or a boyfriend for that matter, though there have been people who tried, I pushed them away. Only some hookups that all left me feeling used and dirty, had to stay in the shower for some hours after each. I kept doing it though, not sure why.


And there’s not even a reason for any of this, no explanation to rationalize it. Good parents, good homelife, upper middle class, good country, not exceptionally dumb, not physically ugly, in good shape, etc.

I honestly don’t think I can survive, I feel like a dead man walking, already buried in my coffin."
7,"""It's the fear of failure, but no urge to be productive.
It's wanting friends, but hating to socialize. 
It's wanting to be alone, but not wanting to be lonely. 

It's caring about everything, then caring about nothing. 
Its feeling everything at once,  then feeling paralyzingly numb."" 

Couldn't have said it better myself."
8,"No one wants me. I graduated university and the only places that will have me are factory and retail jobs. Am I a bad person for wanting better for myself than a dead end retail job? I see friends and family all see success and just see myself as a failure compared to them.
I worked so hard and for what? Depression and anxiety as well as feeling inadequate and bad at everything. Wish I could just give up but I have a dog to look after."
9,"Throwaway post. This is my first post on Reddit. 

I'm only 34, but I'm tired of living. Nothing is fun, nothing is interesting. I have the attention span of a lima bean and I absolutely hate my job and would quit if I didn't need the money to survive. I'm constantly comparing myself to other people and I hate it. I wish I could be like them; motivated, beautiful, and happy. But I don't know how to stop. Last night I went to sleep and found myself literally begging whoever is listening to not let me wake up.  I don't know what to do or who to turn to. My family wouldn't understand. I really do feel like I'd be doing them a huge favor if I wasn't around because I feel like a huge burden. I have very few friends and all I do is go to work, come home, and sleep the rest of the time. I'm tired of pretending. I just want it to be over."
10,I've never understood that phrase. I'm depressed and hate myself and dislike all my flaws while treating them harshly. When I meet a person I can fall in love and forgive all their flaws and still be head over heals for them. My capacity to love people is huge but my capacity to love myself is minimal. I think the only people who say you can't are the people that don't know or understand depression
11,"Basically, even if my life were to improve instantly tomorrow by a miracle it’s going to be too late, I’ve missed out on so much that I have nothing to look back to except pain and misery. Nothing can heal me anymore, they say time heals everything but it doesn’t if anything it makes the pain worse if your life doesn’t continue to improve and it never gets better. 

There’s no pain worse than the pain of missing out on the beauties of life, none. I’ve missed out on important developmental milestones that everyone else experienced but me, i’ve missed out on love, i’ve missed out on belonging, i’ve missed out on feeling like a human being. 

What good is it if it gets better now when up until now all you’ve known is pain and misery? It no longer feels the same past a certain age and all those magical experiences are best experienced at the right place at the right time, if you somehow managed to miss out on them then it’s gonna be too late.

No amount of anecdotes, virtue signaling, toxic positivity or just world fallacy bullshit is able to prove me wrong, I’m tired of pretending everything is okay when it isn’t and never was."
12,"isn't it funny how much negativity they encompass themselves with yet they never realize it. only a matter of time till the house gets filled with yelling, anger and arguments"
13,"We all had great relationships and it was a great family, my mom was amazing, and my dad was amazing. On march 28th, 2020 I woke up to my mom dead on the floor. My dad didn’t recover from the loss and wasn’t happy for the rest of his days, his only will to live was to take care of me and my brother. After a horrible year and 5 months my dad said he was making me breakfast, I walk into the kitchen and he’s lifeless on the floor with blood coming out of his nose and his eyes open. Hypertension. 

I’m now 19 going on 20 in a few months and life doesn’t feel real. I feel so lost. I cant find a word to express my emptiness validly. It’s so painful being alive. I miss my parents so much. This is agony, this terrible rollercoaster called “life” has fell off the tracks and onto the floor. I feel like im going insane, all i do is work and day dream all day. My escape from reality is just drifting off into space.

Please help me, i can’t do this for much longer this pain, this fucking pain, is a piercing unbearable pain deep in my soul that just keeps getting worse daily."
14,"I can see it now. The half-hearted sympathy to my family and 300 Facebook likes on my obituary post.

Where was anyone when I was alive? Nowhere to be found.

Even the suicide hotline doesn't give a shit about me if I'm not holding a gun to my head or hanging off a bridge. 

Nobody cares that I'm alive. Nobody cares that I'm miserable. Nobody cares that I suffer every. fucking. day. 

They only care that I'm not dead."
15,"Doing cbt, taking meds, eating better blah blah. I'm doing all the things I should but I still feel really shitty. I work a kinda low paid job in health care, worked through entire pandemic. I'm super jealous of those who had time to stay at home, explore their hobbies and stuff. I've never really wanted a particular career, but I liked biology and thought that helping others would be rewarding (which I guess it is? But that doesn't pay the bills...essential my ass). I know a lot of my low mood comes from work, from the feeling of spending the majority of my waking hours in some thankless job so that I have enough money to live, then getting home, staring at my phone and sleeping so I can do it the next day. And the next. Over and over for decades. I know I can get a new job, or be happy that I have a job, but I just fucking hate this situation. Even the things I once enjoyed I would hate if I had to do them for 40 hours a week to stay alive. 

Call it depression or burnout I don't fucking care. I didn't ask to be plonked on this planet just to be another gear to generate money for some billionaire. I fucking hate it and no amount of medication and talking is gonna change that."
16,"The reasons why I've decided to end it:

1. No matter what plans I make, I never execute them.

2. Because I can't share it with someone else.

3. I have zero friends.

4. I'm still living at home.

5. I need attention. Some attention. Just *something*. But I'm just a random dude walking by, a nobody.

After years of trying, and after years of reading self-help books, I know it's not going to be better for me.

I gave it a fair chance. After 10 years of still not having my act together, I see no other way than end it.

I have to. I can't keep on living the same day every time.

""Rob a bank."" Yeah, I know. I know. Just *do something different* right? I know. But my mind already knows that it doesn't matter. All of the things I might do differently or improve: it does not matter.

I helped others. I *lived for* others. Doesn't help. After a while, they take it for granted. And you become a doormat, a pushover, a friendly guy.

I hate my life. I've seen enough.

I'm not going to kill myself right away, but *am* going to do so in a couple of days.

I seriously hope that someone out there has the solution. Something that gives me hope.

But man, I am so completely done of this useless, boring existence.

""Just get a job, do X, do that, etc!"" Yes I know. Easier said than done, as always. If I could, I'd already fly to Hollywood and ask some celeb to marry me, I mean come on, life doesn't work like that.

Anyway...

Thank you for reading if you made it this far.

Life just isn't for everyone.

**Edit:**

First of all THANK YOU ALL for your comments. It means a lot and I'm overwhelmed by it. I'm trying to reply to as many of you as I possibly can. If you don't get a reply, know however that I've read it and that I appreciate you taking the time out of your day/night to write. Again, it's much appreciated.

Digital communication can be cold, but I have to stress that I'm not saying 'k thanks y'all I'm cured now bye!' What I do want to say, again, that I absolutely appreciate your words of wisdom, encouragement and hope. It feels good to know that I'm not completely alone.

I'm typing this here for the time being, because I haven't replied to all yet. I want to do so, but need a break now. But again, if you're not getting a reply, it's not because of you, it's because of me. I've read it, and I appreciate it very much. You have no idea how your reply has helped me already!

Thank you all.

**Edit 2:**

Again, thank you all for your replies. I did my best to reply to a lot of you. If you didn't have a reply, please know that it's because of me. And it could be that I'm not seeing your reply; that happens more here. (Sh4d0wbanned?)

Thank you again. You have no idea how much this helped me already.

Over here it's evening already, and I need to have a break for now. I'll do my best to answer more of your replies later.

Again, a big thank you, for all."
17,"Everything is pointless, people judge you for the smallest things, you work until you die, and etc. There are so many things that make life so miserable and boring. How people just manage to wake up and be happy? I just don't understand..."
18,"When I've spoken about the fact that I'm depressed, anxious, the planet is dying etc. a response that always comes up is ""well you can always leave"" a.k.a. implying suicide. Do these people also tell their kids to leave the planet if they're not the happy stereotypes they want them to be? WTF is wrong with these people?"
19,"anyone else just always lowkey waiting to die? haven't attempted in a long time, feel pretty stable, just always kind of background wish i was dead. does it ever go away? pls don't report i'm not going to do anything just wanted to talk about it"
20,"The title kind of says it all. There are things that I want to achieve in this life but I never see them through because most of the time I’m just thinking about what it would be like if I just died one day. Not by killing myself (although I’d be lying if I said that hasn’t crossed my mind) because I wouldn’t want my friends and family to go through that, but by dropping dead  just about anywhere. 

I know these things aren’t mutually exclusive, you can be certain of death and still do something with your life; but for some reason it holds me back. I spend most of the time wishing I was dead, trying to lose weight, watching the same shows over and over again, reading… life is so monotonous and I hate it. Even when I try to do something different I just end up laying awake at night thinking about when it will finally be my turn to rest.

I have a life, too. I have a good relationship with my friends and most of my family. I guess I don’t have a good relationship with myself, with food, with my body, with my sexuality…I have goals and aspirations but at the end of the day I just want to watch tv and eat garbage. I’ve never had a significant other either because I’m too afraid. 

I don’t know what the point of this post is. Guidance maybe. Tips on how to keep going, on how to find motivation or a way for me to be disciplined… please, I just need help.

TLDR: depressed, want to die, need help on how to get up and do something with my life.

Edit: spelling

Edit: thank you for my first award, kind stranger!"

22,"I'm absolutely going insane. I hear voices telling me to off myself. The worst part is, the voices are of the people that I love. It's getting to the point where I don't trust my loved ones anymore.  I've almost ended my life because I'm not always in control. I'm so worried, but I also don't have much of a will to live

Edit: Thank you to everyone who is helping me. I'm safe and I'm going to see a doctor soon."
23,"TL/DR: My mother would watch porn and masturbate in front of me from 8 until 13. She would also walk around naked alot and sometimes had sex with my dad in front of me. Only now at 24 I'm starting to realize the effect it has had on me and I am really depressed about it.

I have had a pretty shit life (Abusive father, alcoholic mother, molested when I was 10, kidnapped and taken to a mental hospital against my will by my Father (The hospital deemed me fit to leave within 3 days, my father was going to let me rot in there for 12 months, and as soon as I got out, him and his new wife blocked me everywhere) My father also refuses to pay for any therapy for me anymore, again just letting me wallow in sadness and not improve)) So yeah life has been kind of awful for me lately.

But recently my abusive mother just died and I started thinking about alot of her actions that I didn't really think much of at the time. But basically her and my father hated each other so they slept in different rooms, which directly led to my mom begging and forcing me to sleep in the same bed as her. Pretty quickly she started watching porn and masturbating in front of me while I watched with her, sometimes she was drunk and sometimes sober (I was 8 years old). This continued on and off for years until I was 13 and demanded to move out. My mother would also walk around naked and sleep naked quite often, right next to me, I saw her naked probably hundreds of times, and she would always bath or use the bathroom without closing the door so I could see. On top of all this, her and my father would have sex once a year or something (They really hated each other) but when they did they would do it in the open, in the bar room with the door open, in the living room (Which has no door at all) and once when I was I think 6 or 7 I was sleeping next to them in a sleeping bag on the floor, and they started having kind of loud sex, and I remember looking up to see my moms face hanging over the bed... I think her eyes were closed but I stared for a while trying to understand what was happening. 

The thing is I actually enjoyed it, I felt special that she would give me this attention but not my brother, and I thought it was completely okay because she didn't touch me. She'd always watch the same videos too (A porn CD boxset that looks like it was from the 90s) and I vividly remember the 90s vibe of the videos. She would also also ask me questions but the one I really remember was ""Would you like it if you were that man?"" to a guy getting a blowjob in front of a fireplace on a red carpet.

After I moved back into my own room at 13, I kind of just didn't even think about it much at all. Sometimes I would but only to reminisce that I enjoyed it and thinking about it turned me on too so I would ask my girlfriend if she wanted to watch porn together, and we would. 

I have kind of only realized recently I have a porn addiction, I love watching porn with friends, tinder dates, random people online, girlfriends, just anyone willing to watch with me and exchange pictures and attention. I also never really viewed it as serious at all, like it's just porn and we aren't even touching, so I was often pretty straightforward in asking people if they want to watch with me Or exchange pictures or something (I am cringing in my soul thinking about it now) and of course it would weird some people out. 

I have seen a therapist but I have told him everything BUT what my mom and I did together, I think because I thought it didn't affect me and also because a part of me finds it embarrassing as it is my own mother. I never even told any of my exes about it, though I would tell them everything else.

But now that my mom is dead and I can't seem to stop thinking about it I plan on seeing my therapist again (After two years) to talk about this as well as a few other things.

But I'm so depressed whenever I think about my mom. I'm only really realizing how badly this porn addiction is fucking me up and I hate it beyond belief. It's only recently am I kind of learning that porn isn't really 'normal' at all. I want to change and I am excited to, but my god, at the moment I'm just so lost and alone with these thoughts of my mom. None of my friends or family know either and I don't know if I will ever have the courage to tell them even after I do therapy.

Sorry for the rant, I'm just really down lately."
24,"I hate when people ask me this because it's not as easy as they think. It's not like I can just list all the reasons why I'm depressed in nice little bullet points. And when I do try to explain it, I can never express myself in a clear way."
25,"I’m currently unemployed for the summer as I saved up enough money to get by but after this I will head back to a 9-5. I’ve job hopped a few times and I do have post secondary education but I hate every job I get. Im miserable and feel extremely suicidal. I’ve felt this way for years. I’m currently 23 and I hate the idea of spending the rest of my life doing something I don’t want to do for 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. I know it’s necessary and I usually get hit the the “typical spoiled millennial” comments but I don’t understand how others don’t think this way as well. I’m sure some people do enjoy what they’re doing for a living. They probably don’t want to go in 5 days a week but I’m sure they’re happy to go in most of the time. But the majority of the people I know dread going into work the next day. I don’t understand the point in living if all we do is drain ourselves doing things we hate until we die anyways."
26,"They aren’t able to “work on themselves”. Meds don’t work. Therapy doesn’t work. Relationships inevitably fail. Friends disappear. Work isn’t fulfilling. Hobbies come and go. 

They just wither away and die alone. 

I think I’ll be one of them."
27,I did it again. Quite amount of blood dropped. I'm tired. I'm sad. I'm angry with god. I hate myself
28,it doesn't matter how many hours I sleep I'm still going to be tired there's nothing that makes me happy anymore everything is hard to do even things that I use to love
29,"I went through an extreme amount of distress, anxiety and depression for the past 5-6 years and I feel it's finally catching up to me in the form of depersonalization. I finally understand what people mean when they say they feel numb. I don't even. Feel like I exist, I have tried so hard to find meaning in life, so many times I went to a park to sit down alone and pray for an answer, for a sign, for anything. I have had really bad depression/anxiety episodes before and this feels so different, I don't feel scared for the future I just feel empty, I wonder how much longer I can push through this. The thing I hate the most about this whole situation is that I am chained to this existence because of my parents, they are such great people and don't deserve to lose a son, but at the same time I feel like I am making too much of a sacrifice for them. Do I really need to stick around for another 30-50 years in this joke of a life until I don't have anything binding me here anymore."
30,"I'm never sad or mad when drunk. Which is weird, cause I always hear that depressed people get even more depressed when drinking. I guess that's just not me then. I'm drunk right now and feel happier than ever. Still never been sad when drunk... This feels like a superpower :D"
31,"And I don't mean random faceless users on a forum. Like you wish you could talk to a friend, someone who knows you, but when you think about talking to any of your friends you can clearly predict where that conversation is going to go and you realize it's not worth it.

Its physically painful that I have friends who always say the whole 'if ever you need to talk' thing, but I can already see how futile a conversation with any one of them would be. It would go nowhere, I wouldn't be able to say what I want to say to them because it just wouldn't be a good idea. I don't even have anyone I can complain to about not having any one to talk to. It sucks being surrounded by friends who are often supportive of each other but wouldn't sympathize with what you've got going on.

Fuck I just want to scream. I'd give anything to be able to spill my guts to someone who knows me. I feel so goddamn isolated and alone."
32,"I just had a strange revelation. I realized that sometimes my depression mood isnt necessarily always feeling depressed like sad or lonely, but like this intense heavy veil of ""never feeling in the mood"". 

I wanna write something I know I will enjoy and love, but I don't feel in the mood... I'm not getting the feel good feelings. I feel dread at the idea of starting and it feels pointless. 

I'm watching my fav youtube channels. They're entertaining and funny but I rarely ever laugh or crack a smile anymore, if ever. I just never seem to be in the mood. And it's hard to focus. 

I wanna play a video game I know I love. I play for a little while but feel nothing. Can't get immersed. Don't feel in the mood. Can't feel invested to get far. 

And it sucks because I wanna laugh, and I wanna get into a fun creative mode and everything but I feel like I'm in this blank, numb state. I either feel sad and lonely, ruminating on things that hurt me or hurt me now, or I feel just so dull and uninterested. So much so I never feel like I'm truly enjoying anything that isn't a fast hit of pleasure, like a cookie. 

It just often feels like this dull void and never feeling in the mood enough for anything and not enjoying much of anything. A lot of anhedonia. A lot of longing for something to fill the void again."
33,"I’m not going to write some long thing about how bad my situation is, but it’s bad. I don’t really want to die but I feel like it’s the only way to end my pain. I feel unloved, I’m treated like shit and I’m in a dark place. I’ve heard it gets better, but when? I’ve been patient. I’ve tried. But I’m tired. My body, mind and soul is so tired. The only thing at this point that’s keeping me here is my dog. He’s 7 and I’ve had him all his life. He’s very attached to me and I’m scared what would happen to him after I’m gone. How do I keep going? How do I stay in a situation that is horrible in every way? Even if I left this house, I would be homeless so that would probably be worse. I think I’m going to live for him and when it’s his time, it will be mine. I’ve already lost everything else so there would be nothing else to live for. I just wish I had the courage to end my life when it’s time. People say they are cowards. I think the opposite, I think they are brave."
34,"Everyday I feel lower, everyday the things i thought were secure slip further away. I've never spoken to anybody about depression, but now that I've tried to reach out to friends, I realize I may need professional help.

Job stress is compiling to the point I want to quit but can't because its a better paying job than anything near me, and I need the money. 10 year relationship is coming to a ugly end, found out she cheated, and I suspect its ongoing. Were going to couples therapy, but it really feels like each day my SO grows colder and colder. Ive never felt so alone in my own home.

I've tried to reach out to friends, not emotionally dump on them, but let them know how I've been feeling. And it really just turns into ""oh man... thats crazy, (insert what they're going through)"". The first time that happened I just focused on them, let them vent. I thought I would feel better being there for a friend. But when it happened with a close friend a week later, I was honest. ""Hey, I really could use an ear right now."" And he just sighed and said, ""bitches lie and cheat. Leave her and save your money"" 

 I get it, its hard all over. But like I said, nobody gives a shit when your life is falling apart."
35,"My therapist told me that I needed to be more vulnerable bc you can't just not feel sadness. If you stop feeling one emotion, you stop feeling them all, including joy. I did the work and I can feel now but it's almost all pain. Life just hurts so much. I feel sadness all the time now and to be honest, I miss the numbness. Pretending to have feelings was much easier than living with constant pain."
36,"I do no longer have physical reactions to my emotions. I get no response in my body. I am just thinking my emotions it feels like. 

Before i had such strong physical reactions to emotions. I miss it. Now it feels like i have no emotions at all. 

I just Feel kind of dead inside. 

I look around and i know it is beautiful, but there is no reaction. 

I Feel extremely disconnected from everything and everyone, and extremely lonely because of this. 

I Feel my emotional reaction just burned out really. One body part after another stopped responding in relation to emotions. 

Sometimes i get stronger emotions, but then i cant Feel them in my mind/mentally. And i dont know why i get the emotion. 

I have even lost my inner world/head space. I cant Feel it anymore. I used to love daydreaming and would think about everything. Now my head is quiet. I cant Feel my space there anymore. It is gone. It gives me so much anxiety and brings on more obsessive thoughts and actions. 

All senses are dimmed. Smell, taste, vision, touch, hearing. It is all off and of less quality. 

What is happening? Can i get my emotions back? Can i get my head and myself back?"
37,"Title says it. I talk to myself a lot when I'm alone. Only out loud in my bedroom, and I talk to myself a lot in my head. Especially when I'm at work I'll be having an inner dialogue with myself. Or like, I'll talk in my room alone like I'm hanging with a friend making quips and stuff out loud even when nobody is there. Idk I'm baked asf so it's hard to explain. I'm not ashamed of it or anything either, just wanted to tell somebody I guess. I think it helps keep me somewhat sane for the most part. Maybe this is just normal? Does anyone have conversations with theirselves in their head? I got no one to talk to so I kinda just talk to the air in my room or myself. I feel pretty isolated a lot so I'm alone with my thoughts most of the time. Lol."
38,I think the worst part about it depression is how isolating it is. People always act like they know cause they had some situational sadness but having this heaviness for years is torture
39,"So.. it’s 2am on a school night, but honestly, I don’t think I’ll end up going today.

Last year I ended up missing 6 months of school.

My father was only mad at me, he has anger issues. I kind of hate him but he isn’t the point of this post.

I’m only 16, but I really worry about my future. My attendance at school is pretty terrible, and even though I got the best marks in English and psychology last term, this term I’m assuming I’ve failed most of my classes.

I told my boyfriend (yes, I’m gay) I’d be at school today. He’s really kind but I lie to him a lot like that.

I just can’t go. I had a break down just thinking about my teacher’s asking me why I didn’t hand in assignments and I’ve even started tearing up now at the thought of leaving the house.

It feels so terrible, like I can’t breathe, and I’m seeing a therapist for my anxiety and depression and since my 6 months of being absent from the world I’ve improved a lot, but lately I’ve gotten worse all over again.

I missed four weeks last term and I didn’t go to school yesterday which was the start of term 3.

I just feel like I can’t do it. I have high aspirations to become a police officer, and I’m currently doing legal studies at school, but at this point I feel like I’m going to fail school because of how absent I am, even though I know I’m capable of getting good grades.

I just keep feeling like I’ll fail school, and I won’t make it into any universities, and that even if I did I couldn’t afford it because I won’t get any scholarships and then I won’t get any good jobs and I don’t want to stay here with my father because he’s emotionally abusive and neglectful (and very homophobic, but that’s another story entirely).

I kept convincing myself that just one more absence won’t change much, because the times I do go to school I just read on my iPad and nothing gets done and it feels like a waste.

&amp;#x200B;

And then I lose all my motivation for everything under the assumption that none of it matters because I’ll eventually kill myself once things get worse, (because at this rate it’s gonna get worse.)

  
The only reason I missed 6 months of school last year is because I tried to kill myself.

Only my father and therapist know. (Father is a douche, therapist is lovely.)

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve decided to skip today because I’m in no condition to go to school, I can barely breathe as it is and I haven’t even stepped outside.

I feel a lot better knowing I’m going to be absent today, but I know it’s just a temporary solution.

What about tomorrow??

Am I just going to skip the whole week? Month?

&amp;#x200B;

I just don’t know what to do at this point.

I‘ve always considered myself at least smart enough to get good grades, but I also feel like an idiot stuck in such a stupid loop.

I should just try harder, things will get better, I shouldn’t give up, nothing bad will happen when I go to school, it’ll be easier once I go and I’ll calm down, 

but dang it’s easier said than done.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the rant.

I should get some sleep.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you... for reading this, if you did.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for wasting your time.

I’ll just.. try to get better, I don’t know."
40,"Fuck this damn planet. Fuck these people, I don't understand how humanity can find pride in itself when people constantly hurt each other and can't find peace with one another. 

I don't care if someone comes to this comment section to tell it ""it's the real world, deal with it"", the same people who constantly shit on others and never help the people in need.

I was bullied, abused by my family, groomed by a stranger, bullied again for speaking up about it, abandoned by my own friends and many, many more. 

Yet I still breathe and live on the samd planet on those people because I'm too weak to take my own life and beat it. Too pathetic. Too cowardly. Why did the universe give a life to someone like me who can't do anything special with it? I could've excelled in school, got awards, praised by my parents, never touched the internet and get a mental illness. I could've been so, so much happier but now I'm here. Crying about my stupid feelings, when it's just another night that nothing changes. 

Nothing changes."
41,"The world sucks and it’s full of shitty people including me, I bring everyone down due to my own hatred for myself and for everything that happens on this shit rock. I have been beaten up, insulted, been told I am worthless and that I will never have someone who actually cares about me and the saddest part is they are right."
42,"It just feels like every good thing I do or positive thing in my life is outweighed by my mistakes / failures and I can’t take living this way. I’m not proud of anything, I mostly feel shame and worry."
43,not sure what to do with myself. kind of just staring blankly at my phone.
44,"Things like ""move forward"", ""things will get better"", ""you'll get over it"", all mean nothing to me. It's torture everyday. Especially when you see how happy everyone else is."
45,"I just don’t want to. And I haven’t wanted to. In all my 24 years of life I legitimately do not recall a moment where I felt like I wanted to be alive. Having intrusive and compulsive negative thoughts from a young age really helped with that I guess. Sure there’ve been fleeting moments where I thought life was kinda cool or enjoyable at times, but none of those would change my mind about whether if I were to be given the choice to painlessly off myself right now to do so. Being instinctively afraid of pain is probably the only thing keeping me here honestly. I’ve seen psychs, I’ve tried different meds for years, nothing seems to help. Exercise, travelling, hobbies, nothing seems worth the effort vs. lying in bed doing nothing. I’d just be lying in bed in a different albeit new place or more tired from pushing myself through exercise. Ultimately the problem is myself, I know. It’s just that after so long of trying to care and seeing no improvements, I’m burned out. If I’m struggling this much in the supposed prime of my life I’d hate to see what’ll happen after. That and, well, I’ve just given up."
46,"What's the point of not taking drugs or drinking if I'm just gonna feel depressed, down and suicidal. I might as well get high and have a good time and feel better. If the result ends up the same why do I keep trying to improve myself. 

At least this way I won't keep depression eating and putting on weight. Might even lose a bit and not feel so disgusted with my body."
47,"My life is just your standard depressed introverted socially-awkward nerd story that you've heard a thousand times. Nothing noteworthy to be honest.

I've been unemployed for a year and my savings are starting to run out. I currently live with my parents and they're extremely supportive, which honestly makes me feel like an even bigger piece of shit and a huge disappointment.

I know it's irrational, but a part of me wishes they would kick me out of the house, since I feel like I deserve that over the kindness they've shown me.

I know I have to get a job soon and the anxiety is starting to eat away at me. My sleep is fucked and I eat a lot less than I used to.

I can't even say I wish I were dead, since I know it would break my parents' hearts, and I don't want to cause that pain to them.

Everything feels hopeless and I find myself wishing for an accidental death. At least that would take away the guilt from suicide and perhaps it would be an easier pill to swallow for my parents.

Anyways, I'm rambling. Sorry to take your time with this stupid rant post.

Have a nice day/evening/night, everyone."
48,"So, I recently told my parents about my depression, after a good year or so, hoping that they could help me or give me advice. Instead, they proceeded in telling me that I don't have any reason to be depressed, and how other people were much more unfortunate.

Wow. Who knew parents could be this supportive?"
49,"So...basically what the title says. I have always found it difficult to find happiness and I've always wondered what the point of life is. If I don't enjoy life, why should I keep on going? The only reason I am still here typing this useless post is because a) I have failed to kms previously and b) I find a bit of strength to keep going because of my dog. Although sometimes when I'm looking at my dog I feel enormous amounts of guilt and sadness because I feel like I don't deserve her. I often apologize to her for me being the way that I am and that she is so unlucky for ending up with me. I do everything I can to give her the best life possible but I just can't shake that feeling.

I have been in therapy since I was 16 and I am now 27. There have been little bits of progress in those 10 years but still I feel like doing the world a favor and just end my life. I guess the biggest thing I achieved was me sort of quitting self harm, and that wasn't even because of myself but because I got put on meds to help control the urges. I still have the urges every now and then but even when I hurt myself I get angry at myself for not doing it ""good enough"".

I have failed in everything I have tried, didn't finish school, never really had a job, no hobby or whatever that excites me, never had a romantic relationship or friends for that matter. Basically I have always been alone and don't have much hope that it will change anytime soon. I don't see a meaningful and successful existence in my future so I am struggling a lot to not just jump in front of a train and get it over with. I suck. I just fucking hate myself.

This post doesn't make a lot of sense, I'm sorry. I just had to vent a little I suppose. I hope that whoever reads this has a good day and thank you for taking the time to read it."
50,Nothing in my life has gone right. Financial stress is drowning me. I don’t know how much longer I can hold on….
51,"I am a 21 male, i have struggled alot with bs in my past. But all that bullshit is starting to come up again. I live in a family of 3, my sister (14) and my brother (19) i am the oldest of the family, i live in a muslim household. And ever since i was 13. I have told them i wasn’t religious. And thats where my hell started getting worse. I am being constantly beaten by both my parents (mainly my dad doing the beating, and my mom supporting it) i am getting yelled at on a daily basis. I recently managed to get something starting to get me out of house. And live in apartments under supervision. The moment my dad found out i was about to be placed out of my house, he threatened to murder me. He threatened me to bring me back to Kurdistan (thats where they are from) and decapitate me there. Because there it is legal to do so.

I called the center and told them to cancel it. He forced to quit my therapy too. I am now hopeless. Everythint i have been building towards is getting ruined. My mental is getting more and more unstable for every night that passes. I havent eaten for 3 days. And my sleep is getting worse and worse. Even my girlfriend got tired of me, and has blocked me everywhere. I loved her more than anything. She was the one and only thing that kept me going in life. Now that is gone too. She is tired of my mood getting worse and worse, my temper is getting worse. And i rarely give her attention. Cuz i slee at 8 and wake up at 16:00 (4 am) everything is fucked. And all i have been doing is complaining to her. I completely understand why she broke up with me. But that just makes me more guilty for how i have treated her. Idfk what to do with my life anymore. I dont have friends. I dont even speak to my parents or siblings anymore. I am trapped in a room without a window. I lost my job. My school, my hope on a place i can call home. I lose everything. I dont have any income left. I havent paid my last 2 phone bills, my last 2 health insurance bills. And i got a fee for quitting my school. Which was originally €1200, only a 280 left to pay. And i cant anymore. I really really cant take it anymore. I find it hard to find a reason to live. No one cares for me. Not even my own familly. Not even my girlfriend. I dont even have friends to ask them to care. I need help. I cant get back into therapy anymore. Cuz there is a waiting queue for 1 year. I wanna end it all. And idfc what to do. Typing this on reddit is truly my last hope

And i am writing this on a throwaway account because i am scared of the people close to me (familly) finding out about this, and making my life a hell of alot worse for typing about this. I am hopeless…

Sorry if this is not the right place to type all of this…. I have no one/no where else to turn to…


Edit: i really aprecciate all the support. You all are truly kind people. I love you all. Thanks for trying so hard. But i still dont see how i can escape this shithole…. Im gonna call my therapist and explain everything. If he is gonna be stubborn and make me wait 1 year idk if i will make it trough the year. I just hope he will understand that i have been forced to call it quits"
52,"This is my first time ever posting in a Reddit forum, and to be honest it makes me really uneasy spilling my darkness even if I’m anonymous. 

As I write this I lay here in bed, end of summer at 2pm. I no longer see the reason in getting up, as at every single corner and every single thing I do or try ends in disappointment. I hope someone can relate, please. 

When I was in my pre/early teens i suffered from severe panic attacks, until I reached about 20 to which it turned into to full blown depersonalization disorder. I was so gone mentally and physically, totally agoraphobic. I was suicidal, not necessarily because of the depression but because I’d simply lost the person I once was. My thoughts, and my appearance- total stranger. 

Once I started going to the bars and being social again it started to subside. I had some decent times but ultimately I’ve been slapped in the face the reality that I never lived my young life, I was never happy. Ive been so unlucky with everything that it’s a running joke with my friends. I’ve never had a girlfriend. Never went to college. I’m reaching 30 and I just so badly want to turn around and live that life. My inner demons have prevented me from all of that. 

My problem is now, because nothing has worked out, I’ve grown so incredibly apathetic. I’m bitter. My therapist essentially gave up on me. He couldn’t figure out how to fix me so he was like idk maybe try acupuncture or something? Wtf. I’m just done."
53,"I don’t know anymore.

It’s a constant cycle. I want to do better. I know I should be doing better. I know I should be spending my time more wisely. 
I know I should be building some sort of career or ‘legacy’. I know I should embrace life for what it is

But what is it?
I’m so tired, hurt, angry and confused. 
I’m so alone.
So lonely.
I complain about it but retreat to isolation as if it’s the only comfort for me. 
I’m starting to stare at couples or just any sort of group of people in complete awe. 
Every day - Every night these thoughts come to me. I want to be happy. I want to be normal so bad.
I want 
I want
I want
I want 
I want 

Meaning
I want something.
Someone 

Today I’m going to do the same thing I did yesterday. 
Nothing
I am nothing. 

I’ll probably spend the whole day in bed looking at the ceiling - no human contact. 
This is nothing new to me. 

I don’t even know the current date or time. I don’t even check as I have no plans or anything I’m expecting. 

I’m tired of this. It’s truly devastating. I don’t know If I can ever recover or fix my situation and that scares me the most. 

I could die this way
I could die alone
I could die unhappy 
Unfulfilled 
I am so scared. I know it’s only you who can save yourself 
But I don’t know who I am anymore

r/NothingButSadness"
54,I’m so alone just existing for the sake of it the loneliness is eating me up touch starved they call it. Hating everything about me I’ve spent years feeling this way hoping for a better tomorrow and I’m still in the same position I was in college with the stress seeing others talking having fun socialising while I’m stuck in my head I’ve took a lot of thought of myself these past days and I think ending it is not so bad after all family are distant with me except for my mother but I just doesn’t feel enough I don’t even know what I want from life or what I’m even aiming for it’s like I’m just along for this miserable ride to I eventually die I just don’t know anymore I brought a noose and I look at it as away out of this feels like the times I enjoyed living when I was a kid has just dried up and I feel like a old man like my life is just ended  What does it mean to be happy? Satisfied
55,I am fucking mad that I can't live alone I'm trying to get there.
56,"Does anyone ever feel like they lost their old, better, less depressed self? If anyone has any tips to help feeling like yourself again to let me know :)"
57,"im looking at my parents rn, they work their ass off all day for all week, working a shitty job that doesnt pay good to get home, eat shit food, sleep and repeat it. and theyve never had the thought that life might not be worth the effort, or that its all pointless. but i guess theyre 'normal', if u add mental illness into the mix and try to make a normal person work all day all week for shitty pay from a shitty job, who wouldnt kill themself? its fucking insane to me that more people in this position arent considering it, like how the fuck is it worth it? its so much work to go to a job all day and interact and use energy to help people and do repetetive tasks all day every day just to barely earn enough money to survive, it simply isnt worth it for me, id really rather be dead. i mean is it that bad a decision? staying alive has literally no positive points for me, its just work, and sleep and in the little free time i have, i get high which is only temporary. no friends, avpd so i cant make any friends and obviously not a fucking girlfriend, nothing is fun, how do normal people do it? are they just so stupid they never consider how much their life sucks? maybe they just dont mind working? maybe their life is actually worth the effort, they dont mind their job as they have lots of reasons to keep going, things to work towards etc. i dont know but how the fuck arent more people freaking out about this, i worked for like 2 days and i already felt suffocated, overwhelmed, on the verge of a panic attack just from being there, its too mcuh knowing i have to do this for bascially the rest of my life, that im on break and still have 8 hours of straight work to go. i really think id rather be dead than just keep putting myself through taht and im fucking baffled at how no one else seems to mind this, i know im not exactly normal and cant relate to the average person but even so, i dont know how they can work even part time, never mind full time and still want to be alive. i think normal people, non mentally ill people are basically a different species at this point. might as well be with how different we are, like trying to compare a lion to a cat. maybe the same thign but very different types"
58,sucks because no one can see how much pain you’re in everyday
59,"I'm in such a bad place right now. Feeling so much depression, anxiety, fear, anger, sadness, hopelessness, pain... If it's a negative emotion, I'm feeling it. Someone asked me what I was doing and I said, ""Waiting. Waiting until it's time to eat, time to sleep, time to go to work. Just waiting.""

I have no outlet for any of this. No one I can talk to that's going to make it better. No one to turn to to just hold me while I cry it out. So, I'll just keep waiting. It's all I can do."
60,Everything I do ends up being a failure. I am tired
61,"I told him I was depressed and he just went back to looking at his phone he didn’t do or say anything I asked him why and he said it’s because he doesn’t know what to do but he’s lying. When we first got together for the first few months he would talk to his ex because apparently she was depressed and wanted to off herself he was always there talking to her and helping her why can’t he do the same for me? I feel worse now I keep thinking about it. I also suffer from anxiety and panic attacks he doesn’t help comfort me with those either I’m going through all of this alone.

Edit: I didn’t just say I’m depressed I told him why I’m depressed and I’ve tried multiple times over 2 years to talk about my problems but he always tells me he doesn’t want to talk about them

Edit2: guys he knows how to talk to someone that’s depressed like I said before he talked to his ex and he also talked to other people that had depression he knows what he’s doing he’s not dumb he just doesn’t care about me. I’ve been telling him every single problem that I had for 2 years and he still doesn’t want to talk. I even told told him he doesn’t have to talk he can just listen but when I try to talk he tells me that he doesn’t want to talk about it or hear about it."
62,"I turned 30 this year and I feel like I don't have much to show for it. I graduated from university with a humanities degree and decided that I wanted to go into law. I work in a legal related job, but it's not at a law firm. I'm beginning to think I will never go into this field as I've left it too late. 

I've also never had a boyfriend and don't have many friends. I was meant to be revising for an exam this weekend, but I've procrastinated all day. I tried to apply for a job, but I couldn't get motivated. 

I have no hobbies or interests. I just work, watch TV, scroll on my phone and go to bed. 

I wished I had spent my 20s doing something fun - I wished I had moved away from home, went out to parties more, and socialised more. Now I'm just a loser. 

I just wish I could rewind my life and do it all again. 

Does anyone know how I can stop feeling like this?"
63,"Fucking when, though??? It's been almost 9 years and nothing is changing. I've moved to a different town, started the school I wanted to, changed medications multiple times, talked to a million different professionals, made a few friends, worked out the knots in my familial relationships, and am trying my best to nourish my body and keep it healthy while forcing myself out of the house at least once a week to get fresh air and be social. But nothing works. 

How long do I have to keep feeling like this before I'm allowed to give up? Nothing seems to help remove this gray filter over my life. Food tastes like cardboard, I never feel like doing anything, I never feel satisfied or happy, nothing brings me joy. I'm just walking from day to day on autopilot waiting for the end to come. I'm running out of things to try, meds to swap. I'm losing hope."
64,"I've been struggling with depression for a few years now.  I really don't want to die- I'd love to live a ""normal"" life, have fun with friends, try now hobbies, travel and enjoy every other thing but i just can't  
 No one chooses to struggle with  basic activities...  


I tried to make an appointment with free  psychologists but I heard things like ""try to think about something positve"" ""focus on one thing when you have a panic attack"". I even  saved some money and went to  psychiatrist, she  prescribed some medications but I can't  even buy them and I can't afford another visit."
65,"That's it. It's a hard pill to swallow but even when good things happen to me, I'm never happy. Something is wrong with me and I need to accept it already. But thinking of always being miserable like this is so fucking scary that I don't see the point of living like this."
66,"I (22) have dealt with depression for literally my entire life. It’s been worse than ever lately so I reached out to friends and family, but it just makes things weird because they don’t know what to do or say and shrug it off. It seems like the more extreme my depression symptoms get, all the support gets replaced with judgement. Everyone wants to help cheer you up when you’re a little sad, but no one wants to be near you when you can’t eat or sleep or stop crying. I’ve also been to a psych ward before, and it was the most negative and traumatic experience of my life. I’ve been to so many doctors and been on so many medications and it takes so much effort and money but only makes things worse or the same. I’m at an absolute dead end. I guess I’m just sharing this here because only people who have been through the same thing can even fathom it or know what to say."
67,"It’s been a bad year. In the space of around 8 months I’ve broken my leg, lost my job and my father has been diagnosed and recently passed from cancer. 

It seems like one thing after the other, lingering effects of my leg and grief are causing me to spiral. Drinking a lot more and can barely get off the couch. How do people get through this shit?"
68,"I know many people in worse situations than me. I have friends and family who are depressed who have to deal with health issues and abusive family members and financial hardships. I’ve realized I don’t really have problems like that, by which I mean problems that are completely out of my control (something I’m very grateful for). Everything that makes me feel depressed and worthless is something that I can control (atleast to some degree), and somehow realizing that has made me feel worse. Cause that just means the reason I’m depressed is me and not shitty external circumstances. Anyone else feel like this?"
69,"I rarely ever feel like I’m good at anything I’ve tried dance, instruments, drawing and the list goes on. I’m terrible at maintaining friendships and relationships because of how insecure and sensitive I am, I’m so jealous everyone around me so I always look like an insecure douchebag in front of people. I have had many friends in the past and they all ended up talking behind my back or just ghosting me. I hate that I clearly need therapy but no one around me cares enough to actually do something about it. I just want to end."
70,I don’t have the energy to do the things everyone expects of me. I don’t want to follow the crowd and live my life the way I’m “supposed” to. I don’t want to do this anymore. Most the people I talk to aren’t really happy deep down and are hiding it behind the facade of a smile. I can see right through it. I hate how fake society is and I wish I could leave it and just live in nature.
71,"One thing that everyone says if you have depression is to go talk to someone and that it'll make me feel better. It didn't change anything for me, if anything it made me feel worse. I despise talking to my loved ones about my problems because it makes me feel so weak, pathetic, and whiny."
72,Does anyone else just wish they wouldn’t wake up tomorrow I don’t even want things to get better I just want this life to be over
73,"I’m so depressed today. I want to scream and cry. I have a pit in my stomach and I wanna die. Please help, I can’t do this today. Anyone talk to me, please."
74,"I feel guilty like I have no place here because I’m not physically sick. I’m waiting to be brought in because I called my doctor and spilled the beans that I’ve been mixing alcohol and other drugs (hard drugs) on the daily and one of these days it’s going to result in an OD if I don’t get help (I get blackout drunk and consume enough drugs to sedate an elephant- and I’m 22F, 5’5 and 115 lbs). I’ve begun losing muscle mass, my skin is horrible and my hair is falling out. I’m extremely depressed and been using substances/video games/sex/shopping/ anything to fill my emotional void… My family has no clue about any of this but if they find out I came here for this reason I should just off myself now. Eastern european parents and talking about mental health just results in me being yelled at or slapped for crying (used to, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it happened again even though I’m an adult now).

Please tell me I shouldn’t be embarassed to be in the emergency room. Please tell me I don’t deserve to live like this anymore and getting help is okay. Please tell me that my ex is wrong and I’m not “weak” or pathetic for being depressed and unmotivated. 

I deserve help. I need it if I’m going to make it past 22.

Update post ER: This was the best decision anybody has suggested for me to make. It was a slow process but there were so many kind people that helped me and talked with me. I wanted to hand out hugs by the end lol. For the first time I feel validated in my feelings that there really is a problem and I’m allowed to fall apart, and pick myself back up and continue. I’ll be starting a (most likely) inpatient rehab/detox tomorrow and I’m excited to get my life back on track. Thank you everyone for your kind words❤️ I’ve been reading and rereading your comments and it’s been helping me to feel less alone. My family still doesn’t know but I’ll have to break the news sooner or later that their daughter needs rehab.. but hey, better rehab than them coming to visit me at the morgue because I overdosed 🤷🏼‍♀️"

Hello,

I have been reading up on the signs and symptoms of depression and anxiety and while I realise that I cannot solve it nor definitively diagnose it, I want to provide my wife with the best support I can. I am attempting to find her a good psychologist to talk to get diagnosed but for the time being I just want to ensure she has adequate support.

some of the symptoms I have noted:

\- fatigue  
\- difficulty sleeping/sleeping in excessively  
\- irritability  
\- loss of interest  
\- worthlessness  
\- hopelessness  
\- suicidal thoughts (rare but they come up, she has also mentioned it in passing she has had them growing up)  
\- excessive worry  
\- difficulty with concentration / decisions  
\- agitation  
\- social withdrawal / does not like to go out much  
\- rapid heart rate / fluttering heart rate (noted a few times, prior I thought it might be a heart arrhythmia)  
\- palpitations  
\- muscle tension - primarily in her upper back sort of between the shoulder blades which from experience is due to stress related things  
\- hypervigilance - mostly over thinking about situations and thinking that everything will go wrong or the worst case scenario will always happen  
\- panic (had at least 4 panic attacks in the last year)  
\- agoraphobia

Just to be clear, I am not diagnosing and I am not trying to white coat it I just note the above, and I just want to be able to provide the best possible support for her - I've tried my best to give her a free space to talk and vent which seems to help but only a little and when she has a panic attack I will go and pick her up from wherever she is and I will take her home and just be there. But outside of this I am a little lost and just don't want to say the wrong thing or do the wrong thing.

Any help is greatly appreciated."
76,"I've been struggling with this for months.. i just feel like i am slowly losing braincells. I space out a lot, i am unable to focus on anything. People talk to me, and i am incapable of understanding what they're trying to tell me. Whenever i want to say something, i can't. I just can't find the right words, or collect my thoughts at all.  I have no opinions anymore, no personality, really. 
I used to be so much smarter. I used to read a lot, now i can barely read a sentence without losing focus. I used to be very opinionated, now i just have no energy to discuss stuff with people. Even when i feel like it, i don't know what to say. I used to be funny, always had something to say. Now i am just boring. There's nothing up there anymore. I just exist. it's so embarrassing.
Is anyone else struggling with this as well?"
77,Does anyone else feel like they are not meant to be around people? Like your fate is to be alone without friendship or family
78,"Doctor: “Do you have suicidal thoughts? Do you have depression? Do you have anxiety? Have you attempted suicide recently?”

Me: No(yes)

What’s the point of even telling a doctor things like that. So they can charge me with medicine that won’t solve my problems?"
79,The flashbacks. Seeing those Text meassages over and over again. The images in my head. The memories. The realisations.The blind rage. The fear. The doubts. The panic attacks when I feel like I'm getting lied to. I'm lost.
80,"i can't be the only one who finds that a load of shit, right? i have legitimately never wanted to be alive, i've always wanted to die. i just wish i could *do it* already."
81,"I struggle with depression and I have my ups and downs but I can not do this anymore. I hate that my friends worry about me. If I just ended it on the date I planned awhile ago there would be nothing to worry about. I have been okay recently but I have been on edge lately. The littlest things tick me off and I do not know how to comprehend these feelings, I hate them. I get angry at such the smallest things and when my friends ask me what's wrong I do not know how to comprehend these feelings to them. They have told me in the past that I am stupid for always wanting to end my life over the smallest things. I have trauma from my past but I feel like it shouldn't even matter since others have had it worse than I have. About a month ago, I started to feel these emotions rise from my body and I hate it, I want to isolate myself until it goes away but my last episode lasted around 6 months and my friends would hate me if I ghosted them for longer than a week. I do love them so much but this feels like it should be my own problem. I play video games to escape the reality of my shitty life but it doesn't help. I am just so tired. I don't want to wake up somedays, I want to finally be at peace. Is it selfish to want to die? Dying would feel so much better than battling these thoughts every single day. I started writing notes to all of my friends and I keep looking at these letter like should I send them? Am I really going to leave this world or am I going to chicken out again? A disconnection between my friends and I has started and it hurts me. I want them to realize that they have a life without me so it would be easier to move on when I am gone. I don't take pics with them for the same reason. I look in the mirror and I don't see myself. I feel disconnected from the person I used to be. I miss her, she was so cool and funny, she smiled a lot more. She was the person I strive to be now. Why do I do this?."
82,"None of the people I have chosen to have in my life have ever made me feel like I am there first choice in anything. Everyone has a closest best friend, even my best friend. He has a girlfriend, and i'm happy for him because she's really sweet, and rightfully so I'm not his priority. But i just want someone to pick me first. When I ask someone to go do something, and they have plans, I want them to atleast have a moment where they consider cancelling their other plans to hangout with me. I know they care about me, they wouldn't be around me if they didn't, but I just want them to care more. I've never felt valued as a friend, and I just want one person to treat me as a priority. It's really hard feeling expendable, knowing that if I disappeared everyone would be able to turn to their favorite person to cope. I'm the friend who always reaches out to others, no one starts conversations with me if I don't do it first. 

I don't think it's selfish to want to be valued. I'm happy that all of the people I love have someone that makes them as happy as their best friends do. It's just been death by a thousand cuts recently, and it fucking hurts"
83,"This is a problem thats eating me alive.

Everytime I hear about the cool and social stuff my friends have done I get really depressed and jelous

Even if I've been doing stuff I enjoy, just seeing other people in relationships or having fun in general makes me compare myself and what thus making me feel lonely and sad. I feel like I haven't done anything in life.

 And I do have hobbies but they arent as social as my friends hobbies so they meet with new people and go on camps and just have fun with a big group in general. 
And the worst part is that I feel like I have the potential to  fit into a group like that but I just cant. 

If you have any advice on how I should deal with this I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks."
84,"I’m so fucking lonely and empty it hurts. I live alone. I have no friends. I was gone for three weeks and had multiple coworkers not even notice.

My therapist has no appointments so I can’t see her. My doctor was the only person who talked to me regularly to make sure I wasn’t fucking dead and he retired. I literally have *no one*.

I can’t even get strangers online to notice me even if I’m begging for help. I feel like such a fucking loser and a waste of space I want to die"
85,"I feel like along with increased depression I've had really bad anger issues lately. Like I'm so snappy and just mad at everything. Not to mention absurdly self critical, defensive and increasingly antisocial. I recently came off lexapro after being on it for a little under a year. Dunno if that's part of it."
86,"People always say ""there is always someone who has it worse"" and realistically, they're right.. but I just can't seem to get the thought of ""I'm just lazy and worthless"" after hearing/reading about others' depression. It makes me feel like I'm just fucking around in life, hiding behind the word depression to excuse me for not doing what I'm supposed to do.   
And the worst thing about having anxiety and a racing mind is that I convince myself a lot of times that this is true."
87,"I have apathy towards my future and zero life goals. I literally live one day at a time and I have no plans for my life. My only source of motivation and happiness was my long-term sentimental relationship and we broke up a couple of months ago because I was basically leeching off my partner's resources, becoming more and more emotionally unavailable, and overall not contributing anything to the relationship anymore.

Now I'm back living at my parent's home trying to get back on my feet but I'm not even sure what that's supposed to be like. I feel like I have nothing to offer to the world. I have no friends aside from my ex and not being able to talk to another human being is driving me crazy. I have some art talent but in my emotional state I'm far from a position where I can create something and enjoy both the process and the result.

Some days I have this short euphoria where I feel like I can turn my life around and become a better version of myself, only to feel utterly hopeless and severely depressed the next day. I'm mostly angry at myself for ruining the only good thing I had in my life and not trying hard enough to make it work."
88,"When I was a teen, I had a bedtime “ritual.” In bed, I would often imagine scenarios where I would fall in love with imaginary people who would treat me badly, and that these people eventually would only realize how much I meant to them when I leave them, disappear (move to a different place), or die.

When I would go to bed after having fights with my parents, I would imagine me dying and that my parents would only realize that they shouldn’t have said or done what they did to me after my death. 

These thoughts would often bring me to tears and I would cry myself to sleep.

I found these thoughts, and crying, to be very comforting to the point that I often looked forward to bedtime. I can’t remember how or when these thoughts stopped.

I couldn’t find anything online that talks about this and nor do I know of people who did this.

Did any of you do this? Is this normal at all?"
89,"I was quite happy with my current state of being. For the first time in years I achieved my goals, got accepted to university and even passed the first year. I also started seeing a therapist and taking meds. Everything was fine, for an entire year I did barley think about my depression, then one stupid thing happens and I'm back to lying in bed all day long and crying not being able to do anything.

It just sucks loosing progress of an entire year within hours. I just don't think this entire shit is worth the effort."
90,"I've been on anti depressants for about 7 months now. They were helping to level me out but lately it feels like they aren't working.

I keep hitting these extreme highs and lows. One minute I'm feeling okay, and then if something negative comes along I just crash, and when I crash it's full on into ""I'm fucking done"". It makes me feel like I'm never really happy, I'm just distracting myself from how miserable I am.

I really don't know what to do about it anymore. I try and find things that make me happy. But all of my interests are incredibly expensive hobbies and I'm torn between making the responsible financial choice or being happy. So when I do decide to make myself happy I feel super guilty the entire time because it wasn't the ""right"" choice.

I'm tired of living like this and I don't know what to do."
91,"I've had depression and suicidal thoughts for a big part of my life, even when it was really bad i never had help i lived through it myself, now this year i was feeling better, i tried to get a job and i succeeded, but it's only been two days and i already cried 7 times, i was feeling optimistic but there is just something wrong with me deep down that never got cared of. So better late than never during a broke down i told my mom everything, i called her and I'll finally get the help i should've gotten so long ago. 

i stood 10 minutes with the phone in hand crying but i did do it, forced myself i knew this was the only thing i had to do. I cried of joy thereafter, it can only go uphill from here.

Now i hope I'll get the help i called for, i can only hope."
92,"Just venting because I don’t got no therapist to talk to … But I’m just so tired of feeling like this world is not for me. I just want to escape and go to another dimension where I can be free and don’t have to worry about finding a job to help me survive it’s so mf frustrating. On top of that I’m bored as hell with life and it just makes me sad. I don’t know what to do anymore. i just be wanting to give up because it’s so easy. Why does this Earth have to be so cruel and make us go through hell? For what? I be stressing out everyday and it’s so sad. Anyways. just wanted to vent this out. I’ll probably won’t get any replies but whoever is reading this, thanks for taking the time out of your day to do so."
93,"I'm tired of crying every other evening...
I'm tired of feeling lonely all the time even when there are people around me...
I'm tired of always being the least important and most disposable person to everyone around...
I'm tired of loosing my psychologist and having to look for a new one every once in a while...
I'm tired of antidepressants not working...
I'm tired of being left behind by people who are important to me...
I’m tired of playing this game of ""hide-and-seek"" with people around me...
I'm tired of knowing so little people with common interests and being unable to befriend new ones...
I'm tired of having noone to go to with my problems...
I'm tired of not having fun from things that used to make my day...
I'm tired of my constant failures whenever it comes to things that are important to me...
I'm tired of trying my best only to make things worse...
I'm tired of my family situation...
I'm tired of bs at my university...
I'm tired of my lack of motivation to do anything productive...
I'm tired of being alone...
I'm tired of still having hope that things will be better...
I'm tired of myself...
I'm just tired of living...
I just wish there was a way to stop time and get some rest from all of this..."
94,"As the title says i am trans and i will go back to that after i give some context to why i'm even posting here.
I have been struggling with depression since i was 13 and at the same time realized i was trans but denied it because i wasn't ready to deal with that.
For all those years since it started i've had very bad episodes of being depressed for months, sometimes i get better for no reason then go back to wanting to kill myself.

I started medication when i was 15 or 16 and have had that medication up until a few days ago, i have been going through the process of changing my mecidatiom and now i'm off meds and i'm pretty sure all of you know that's a slow process.

Today i start in a new school and have to move to a dorm because the school is in a different city, i'm already stressef because firstly i don't have any strenght or motivation to study and now comes the part about me being trans.
I came out to my mom, stepdad and sibling when i was 15 and my dad and stepmom when i was 16 but i haven't told an irl friend i will be going to the sale school with and i don't want to.
But if i don't tell her and explain why i want to be called something else then my deadname i will have to be deadnamed and misgendered by the teachers and that friend for the next 2-3 years, if anyone here is trans i'm sure they know that doesn't feel nice to be closeted just bc you're scared or don't have the strength to deal with the possible outcomes of peoples reactions and so on.

I also have social anxiety and never really had friends irl, atleast not ones that stayed or even cared about me, since i've struggled with that i can't risk losing an only irl friend by coming out.
I don't want to be alone at school anymore, been bullied since i was 7 up until i was 15 so i don't want any more of that or having to sit alone or eat alone.
Last school i was at i had some sort of friends but not those kinda people that i would come out to or even talk to after school and i didn't.
I am extremly depressed right now, i have been through so much shit and rn while being on the damn edge and trying not to end my life i don't have the strenght for any of this.
I rather just pass away, i don't want anyone to worry as i'm not planning anything but i really need some support."
95,"I know. More self pity. It hurts. It hurts when a friend calls me wanting to do something and I have to say ‘no’ not because I don’t want to. Because I am broken - mentally unstable and not fit to be around anyone. I feel dead inside and can’t put on a ‘mask’ anymore pretending that everything’s okay. I hate the feeling of disappointment and disconnection I feel each time I let a friend down. The old me would of went - no questions asked. The person I am now is so far gone, I’m honestly embarrassed. I don’t know who I am, what I’m doing, I don’t like anything I used to like - I’m lost. 

Time is just being wasted. I couldn’t tell you anything I’ve achieved in the last few years. 
I really hope I get out of this


r/NothingButSadness"
96,"I finally hit rock bottom, never felt worse before"
97,"Sometimes I’m just doing mundane things, like driving somewhere or getting groceries… and I have this overwhelming urge to just cry, sob and break down. I feel like I could fall apart at any given moment but I have to remind myself that it is not the place or time."
98,I don't have a lot of reasons to keep doing this. It feels like I'm just keeping up appearances for others. Why does my own skin have to be so inhospitable? Drinking isn't filling the void anymore.
99,"I don't know anymore. Ever since I became depressed at a young age I became very bitter towards who has it better than me. They have caring families, no mental issues and a place they can call home. Even if they do run into issues they have friends and family who will understand them and help them overcome it. I envy them. Family, parents and relatives would always downplay on me so I never look up to them. I have friends right now but it really does not feel like it. Like there is always this certain undertone which they just hate me and talking behind my back cus they don't want to be upfront with me about it. And I hate it. These thoughts are eating me away and it feels like my friendships are not real. It's like they're putting up with my crap just cus they took pity of me."
